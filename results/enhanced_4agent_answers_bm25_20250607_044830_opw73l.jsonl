The paper proposes a two-stage method where the pancreas is first segmented into a binary mask, and then a FusionNet is used to classify the scans based on both the binary mask and the CT image. The optimal architecture of the FusionNet is determined through a search within a pre-defined functional space. The paper reports that combining shape and texture information improves the model's performance, achieving a specificity of 97% and a sensitivity of 92% on the tested dataset. \n\nHowever, Document [3] does not provide specific links to the code used in the paper.

Nonetheless, without direct reference to the IWSLT2015 dataset in the given documents, specific metrics for this benchmark cannot be listed [1], [2], [3].\n\n## References\n\n[1] \"Unknown Title.\" arXiv:2102.12330\n    Passage: \"Re-Evaluating GermEval17 Using German Pre-Trained Language Models. { The lack of a commonly used benchmark data set (collection) such as\\n(Super-)GLUE (Wang et al.\"\n\n[2] \"Unknown Title.\" arXiv:2404.03563\n    Passage: \"EASSE-DE: Easier Automatic Sentence Simplification Evaluation for German. { In this work, we propose EASSE-multi, a framework for easier automatic\\nsentence evaluation for languages other than English.\"\n\n[3] \"Unknown Title.\" arXiv:2105.06027\n    Passage: \"Towards Human-Free Automatic Quality Evaluation of German Summarization. { Evaluating large summarization corpora using humans has proven to be\\nexpensive from both the organizational and the financial perspective.\"\n\n", "was_split": false, "sub_questions": [], "questions_processed": 1, "citation_count": 3, "total_filtered_docs": 3, "full_texts_used": 3, "processing_time": 72.42753791809082, "retriever_type": "bm25", "passages_used": [{"citation_num": 1, "doc_id": "2102.12330", "paper_title": "Unknown Title", "paper_id": "2102.12330", "authors": "Unknown", "year": "Unknown", "context_passage": "Re-Evaluating GermEval17 Using German Pre-Trained Language Models. { The lack of a commonly used benchmark data set (collection) such as\\n(Super-)GLUE (Wang et al.", "passage_preview": "Re-Evaluating GermEval17 Using German Pre-Trained Language Models. { The lack of a commonly used benchmark data set (collection) such as\\n(Super-)GLUE (Wang et al."}, {"citation_num": 2, "doc_id": "2404.03563", "paper_title": "Unknown Title", "paper_id": "2404.03563", "authors": "Unknown", "year": "Unknown", "context_passage": "EASSE-DE: Easier Automatic Sentence Simplification Evaluation for German. { In this work, we propose EASSE-multi, a framework for easier automatic\\nsentence evaluation for languages other than English.", "passage_preview": "EASSE-DE: Easier Automatic Sentence Simplification Evaluation for German. { In this work, we propose EASSE-multi, a framework for easier automatic\\nsentence evaluation for languages other than English..."}, {"citation_num": 3, "doc_id": "2105.06027", "paper_title": "Unknown Title", "paper_id": "2105.06027", "authors": "Unknown", "year": "Unknown", "context_passage": "Towards Human-Free Automatic Quality Evaluation of German Summarization. { Evaluating large summarization corpora using humans has proven to be\\nexpensive from both the organizational and the financial perspective.", "passage_preview": "Towards Human-Free Automatic Quality Evaluation of German Summarization. { Evaluating large summarization corpora using humans has proven to be\\nexpensive from both the organizational and the financia..."}], "document_metadata": {"1": {"doc_id": "2102.12330", "paper_info": {"title": "Unknown Title", "authors": "Unknown", "venue": "arXiv", "year": "Unknown", "paper_id": "2102.12330"}}, "2": {"doc_id": "2404.03563", "paper_info": {"title": "Unknown Title", "authors": "Unknown", "venue": "arXiv", "year": "Unknown", "paper_id": "2404.03563"}}, "3": {"doc_id": "2105.06027", "paper_info": {"title": "Unknown Title", "authors": "Unknown", "venue": "arXiv", "year": "Unknown", "paper_id": "2105.06027"}}}}
