However, the specific mention of the Asteroids game in the context of benchmarking is not directly detailed in the provided document summaries. \n\nFrom the documents:\n\n- Document 1 discusses \"Width-based Lookaheads with Learnt Base Policies and Heuristics,\" which could be applied to various Atari games, including Asteroids, but does not specifically mention benchmarking on Asteroids.\n  \n- Document 2 focuses on \"Learning from the memory of Atari 2600,\" suggesting a method that could be applied to Asteroids, but again, does not specifically mention benchmarking on Asteroids.\n\n- Document 3 provides a review of deep reinforcement learning in Atari, mentioning benchmarks, challenges, and solutions but does not specify which models were benchmarked on Asteroids.\n\n- Document 4 introduces \"Planning from Pixels in Atari with Learned Symbolic Representations,\" which could be relevant to Asteroids but does not explicitly state benchmarking on Asteroids.\n\n- Document 5 discusses \"Mask Atari for Deep Reinforcement Learning as POMDP Benchmarks,\" which might involve Asteroids but does not specify the models benchmarked on Asteroids.\n\nGiven the information provided, I don't have enough specific details to list the exact models benchmarked on the Atari 2600 Asteroids dataset. However, it's clear that various reinforcement learning models and techniques have been applied to Atari games, including Asteroids, as part of broader benchmarking efforts in the field.", "retrieval_strategy": "bm25", "retrieval_method": "bm25_strategy", "documents_used": 5, "processing_time": 37.47672700881958, "alpha": null}
