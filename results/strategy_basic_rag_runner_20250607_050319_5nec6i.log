When, Where, and What? A New Dataset for Anomaly Detection in Driving Videos. pipeline to detect, localize,\nand recognize anomalous events from egocentric videos. We introduce a new\ndataset called Detection of Traffic Anomaly (DoTA) containing 4,677 videos with\ntemporal, spatial, and categorical annotations. A new spatial-temporal area\nunder curve (STAUC) evaluation metric is proposed and used with DoTA.\nState-of-the-art methods are benchmarked for two VAD-related tasks.Experimental\nr...

However, common metrics for evaluating reinforcement learning models on Atari games include the average reward over episodes, success rate (percentage of games won), and human-normalized scores (comparing the model's performance to human performance). For precise metrics used in the context of the Alien benchmark, one would need to refer to specific research papers or datasets that focus on this particular game.

However, it is common in natural language processing tasks to use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

For precise metrics, one would need to refer to the original papers or datasets directly.

2025-06-07 06:24:27,556 - STRATEGY_BASIC_RAG_Runner - INFO - ‚úÖ Answer: Based on the provided documents, the models that have been benchmarked or used in relation to the Atari 2600 Venture dataset include:

1. Width-based Lookaheads with Learnt Base Policies and Heuristics (Document 1)
2. Memory-based learning approach (Document 2)
3. Deep Reinforcement Learning models (Document 3)
4. Models using Learned Symbolic Representations (Document 4)
5. Deep Abstract Q-Networks (Document 5)

However, it's important to note that not all of these models may have been directly benchmarked on the Atari 2600 Venture dataset. The documents suggest that these models have been applied or discussed in the context of Atari 2600 games, but specific benchmarking results on the Venture dataset are not detailed in the provided information.

2025-06-07 06:38:33,127 - STRATEGY_BASIC_RAG_Runner - INFO - ‚úÖ Answer: The question asks for the top performing model in terms of Params score on the ImageNet dataset. However, none of the provided documents directly state the name of the top performing model in terms of Params score. 

Document 1 discusses the performance of 523 ImageNet classifiers but does not specify a top performer in terms of Params score.

Document 2 focuses on using auto-generated contours as a replacement for labeled real-image datasets, which is not directly related to identifying a top-performing model by Params score.

Document 3 analyzes mistakes on ImageNet but does not mention a top-performing model by Params score.

Document 4 discusses out-of-distribution detection on ImageNet-O, which is a variant of ImageNet, but does not provide information on the top-performing model by Params score.

Document 5 introduces ImageNet-E for benchmarking neural network robustness via attribute editing, but again, it does not specify a top-performing model by Params score.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the documents, I don't have enough information to answer the question about the top performing model in terms of Params score on the ImageNet dataset.

2025-06-07 06:57:54,758 - STRATEGY_BASIC_RAG_Runner - INFO - ‚úÖ Answer: The documents provided do not explicitly mention specific evaluation metrics commonly used when benchmarking models on the Atari 2600 Asterix dataset. However, in the context of reinforcement learning and Atari games, common evaluation metrics often include:

1. **Average Reward**: The average score achieved by the agent over multiple episodes.
2. **Success Rate**: The percentage of episodes in which the agent achieves a certain level of performance or completes the game.
3. **Learning Curves**: Plots showing the agent's performance over time, which can indicate how quickly the agent learns.
4. **Human Normalized Score**: The agent's score normalized by the average score of a human player.

These metrics are typically used to assess the performance and progress of reinforcement learning models on Atari games. However, without more specific information from the documents, this list is based on general practices in the field rather than direct references from the provided texts.

2025-06-07 07:50:18,125 - STRATEGY_BASIC_RAG_Runner - INFO - ‚úÖ Answer: Based on the provided documents, several models and approaches have been applied or discussed in the context of benchmarking on the Atari 2600 Asteroids dataset or similar Atari environments. However, the specific mention of the Asteroids game in the context of benchmarking is not directly detailed in the provided document summaries. 

From the documents:

- Document 1 discusses "Width-based Lookaheads with Learnt Base Policies and Heuristics," which could be applied to various Atari games, including Asteroids, but does not specifically mention benchmarking on Asteroids.
  
- Document 2 focuses on "Learning from the memory of Atari 2600," suggesting a method that could be applied to Asteroids, but again, does not specifically mention benchmarking on Asteroids.

- Document 3 provides a review of deep reinforcement learning in Atari, mentioning benchmarks, challenges, and solutions but does not specify which models were benchmarked on Asteroids.

- Document 4 introduces "Planning from Pixels in Atari with Learned Symbolic Representations," which could be relevant to Asteroids but does not explicitly state benchmarking on Asteroids.

- Document 5 discusses "Mask Atari for Deep Reinforcement Learning as POMDP Benchmarks," which might involve Asteroids but does not specify the models benchmarked on Asteroids.

Given the information provided, I don't have enough specific details to list the exact models benchmarked on the Atari 2600 Asteroids dataset. However, it's clear that various reinforcement learning models and techniques have been applied to Atari games, including Asteroids, as part of broader benchmarking efforts in the field.
