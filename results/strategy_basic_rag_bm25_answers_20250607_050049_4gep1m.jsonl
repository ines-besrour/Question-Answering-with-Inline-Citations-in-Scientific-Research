Improving Lexically Constrained Neural Machine Translation with Source-Conditioned Masked Span Prediction (Document 5): This method introduces a mechanism to predict and mask spans in the source text that should be translated with specific terminology. It's a soft constraint as it guides the model without hard restrictions.\n\nThese soft-constrained methods differ from hard-constrained decoding methods in that they do not strictly enforce the use of specific terminology during the decoding process. Hard-constrained decoding methods might degrade translation quality or increase complexity because they can force the model to use certain terms even when they might not be the most contextually appropriate, leading to unnatural or awkward translations. Soft-constrained methods, on the other hand, provide guidance without imposing rigid restrictions, allowing the model to maintain fluency and coherence while still incorporating desired terminology.", "retrieval_strategy": "bm25", "retrieval_method": "bm25_strategy", "documents_used": 5, "processing_time": 37.8455228805542, "alpha": null}

While it doesn't explicitly mention SQL-to-text for data augmentation, the adaptation of a large language model could potentially be extended to generate SQL queries from text, which could then be used to augment the training data.\n\nDocument 5 (ID: 2112.06311) discusses Weakly Supervised Text-to-SQL Parsing through Question Decomposition. This approach leverages question decomposition to improve parsing with limited supervision.
