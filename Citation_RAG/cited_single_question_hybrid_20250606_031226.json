  "question": "explain to me How we can Controll discrete quantum walks",
  "answer": "Controlling discrete quantum walks involves manipulating the coin degrees of freedom, which offer a wider range of controls over the evolution of the walk compared to continuous time quantum walks [1]. This can be achieved by adjusting parameters such as the coin operator used in the quantum walk [1]. For instance, the Hadamard coin produces different behavior than the Grover coin [2]. Additionally, the initial state of the quantum walk can also be controlled to influence its evolution [1]. These methods allow for the exploration of various possibilities in controlling the dynamics of discrete quantum walks on regular graphs and can lead to periodic behavior on small cyclic graphs [1]. \n\nFurthermore, the coined quantum walk on a line can be understood as an interference phenomenon, which can be classically implemented and has already been observed [2]. This perspective provides an analogy between the evolution of walker positions in a quantum walk and the propagation of light in a dispersive optical fiber [2]. \n\nIn summary, controlling discrete quantum walks involves adjusting coin operators and initial states [1], and understanding the interference phenomena involved [2].\n\n## References\n\n[1] \"Controlling discrete quantum walks: coins and intitial states.\" arXiv:quant-ph/0304204\n    Passage: \"Controlling discrete quantum walks: coins and intitial states. { In discrete time, coined quantum walks, the coin degrees of freedom offer the\\npotential for a wider range of controls over the evolution of the walk than are\\navailable in the continuous time quantum walk.
