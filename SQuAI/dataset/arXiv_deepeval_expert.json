This phenomenon can be studied through experimental design and simulations by examining the collision of two particles with generic angular momenta near the inner horizon. The research indicates that a critical angular momentum is required for the divergence of energy at the horizon, and with such an angular momentum, the particle can never reach the horizon due to a potential barrier. However, the inner horizon of a non-extremal Kerr black hole can facilitate ultraenergetic collisions without the need for fine-tuning, making it a more practical and realizable scenario compared to extremal black holes. Future research directions may involve further exploration of the BSW mechanism, investigation of the effects of spin parameter 'a' on collision energies, and simulation of particle collisions in various spacetime scenarios to inform our understanding of high-energy phenomena in astrophysics and cosmology.",

        ". We find that a critical angular momentum is required for the divergence of E_{c.m.} at the horizon. However, with this angular momentum, the particle can never reach the horizon. In relation to Lake's work, we first prove that no divergence of energy occur at the inner horizon for particles with generic angular momentums. A critical angular momentum is required for the divergence. We show with an explicit example that two particles can fall from infinity all the way to the inner horizon and collide with an arbitrarily high center of mass energy. We have shown that such arbitrarily high energies can be obtained in any non-extremal Kerr spacetime, unlike the case in that requires the black hole to be exactly extremal. Since extremal black holes do not exist in nature, the ultraenergetic collisions near Cauchy horizons may be more practical and realizable.\nAcknowledgements: This research was supported by NSFC grants 10605006, 10975016 and by“the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities”.",
        ", allowing them to fall from anywhere outside the black hole. Our analysis shows that infinite energies can only be attained at the horizon and one of the particles must have a critical angular momentum. However, with such an angular momentum, there always exists a potential barrier outside the black hole preventing the particle from approaching the event horizon.Since the event horizon of a non-extremal Kerr black hole cannot serve as a particle accelerator creating infinite collision energies, it is natural to ask whether the inner horizon can make a difference. This issue has recently been explored by Lake . The author claimed in the original version that the center of mass energy for two colliding particles is generically divergent at the inner horizon and no fine tuning is required. Then in the Erratum this claim was withdrawn because physical constraints forbid such collisions. We reexamine this issue in details and arrive at the following conclusions. We first confirm, using different arguments, that a generic divergence at the inner horizon is not possible. We further show that for a critical angular momentum, the center of mass energy diverges at the inner horizon. Such a divergence is similar to that proposed by BSW where a critical angular momentum also is required. The difference is that there is no restriction on the spin parameter a. So in",

We study particle collisions near the event horizon (outer horizon) and Cauchy horizon (inner horizon) of a non-extremal Kerr black hole. Firstly, we provide a general proof showing that particles cannot collide with arbitrarily high energies at the outter horizon. Secondly, we show that ultraenergetic collisions can occur near the inner horizon of a Kerr black hole with any spin parameter $a$.\nIntroduction: Whether Kerr black holes can serve as particle accelerators with infinite collision energy has recently been discussed. Bañados, Silk and West showed that particles falling from rest outside an extremal Kerr black hole (a=M) can collide with arbitrarily high center of mass energies when the collision occurs arbitrarily close to the horizon. The BSW mechanism has been further discussed and generalized to different spacetimes (See e.g. - ). Jacobson and Sotiriou pointed out that infinite energies for the colliding particles can only be attained at infinite time. Authors also argued"

The latter force is in an unusual way related to the properties of the cavity medium and mirrors.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the best performance among all the published methods using this benchmark task with the same setup, including all the participants in the recent MS-Celeb-1M challenge at ICCV 2017\\footnote{http://www.msceleb.org/challenge2/2017}.\nIntroduction: One-shot face recognition is to recognize persons with only seeing them once (Figure REF ). This problem exists in many real applications. For example, in the scenario of large-scale celebrity recognition, it naturally happens that some celebrities only have one or very limited number of images available. Another example is in the law enforcement scenario: it is usually the case that only one image of the personal ID is available for the target person. The challenge of one-shot face recognition lies in two parts.First of all, a representation model is needed to transfer the face image into a discriminative feature",
        " image for a given celebrity is provided to search for another face image for this celebrity from up-to one million distractor images from regular persons. Since this task requires participants to extract feature vectors for all the face images and use 1-NN method to search for the image with the smallest distance, this task mainly focuses on evaluating the first challenge of the one-shot face recognition: to learn a discriminative face representation model. Recently, there has been another benchmark task called MS-Celeb-1M: low-shot challenge proposed. This task focuses on one-shot learning in the large-scale face recognition scenario. The task is to study, with these training images only, how to develop an algorithm to recognize the persons in both data sets. The main focus of this task is the recognition accuracy for persons in the low-shot set as it shows the one-shot learning capability of a vision system, while also checking the recognition accuracy for those in the base set to ensure no harm to their performance.Most recently, one-shot learning has attracted great attentions, attempting to make progress towards imparting this human ability to modern recognition systems , , , , , , , . Generally, there are two ways to improve the low-shot face recognition performance. The",

In total, this dataset contains 21K people with 1.2M images, which is considerably larger than other publicly available datasets except for the MS-Celeb-1M dataset. To evaluate the one-shot challenge, we divide the dataset into base set (20K) parts, i.e., base set (20K people) and novel set (1K people). Since we want to build a general 21K-class classifier for both the base and novel classes, we hope our optimized classifier achieve promising performance on both sets, otherwise it is meaningless in the real-world applications.In the base set, there are 20K persons, each of which having 50-100 images for training and 5 for test.

To reduce their workload, some exciting progress has been made on generating images with a given background.

Given a specific rectangle bounding box on background image, the method returns the most compatible foreground objects to paste from given candidates. However, the model is still unable to find the best location and scale of the foreground, since the bounding box is directly given by human.To overcome these shortcomings, we proposed Auto-Retoucher(ART) framework to generate composite images that are harmonious both in appearance and location. A multitask verifier model will utilize semantic parsing and content features to calculate scores for both the global consistency and the spatial consistency. Then a gradient-based adjustment algorithm based on the surface of our verifier model will adjust the foreground object into the most suitable location. Since no previous work has been done on this specific task, existing datasets is not available. Therefore, we created a new dataset with 300K images for the Auto-Retouching task. Experiments are conducted on this dataset to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our method. We prove that our model performs well on this dataset.To summarize, the main contributions of our work are four-fold:We proposed a novel multitask verifier model to evaluate the"

The adapting of the plan is implemented by specializing the underspecified entity descriptions contained in the plan. Intelligence here lies not in finding the correct sequence of actions but in the choice of action parameterizations that avoid failures and lead to successful task execution. For example, the robot might need to answer a question such as: \"If I grasp the cup from the handle with my left arm, will I be able to place it at the designated location without having to regrasp?\" and based on the answers choose the arm to grasp with. We present a fast plan projection mechanismOpen-source code and tutorials: http://cram-system.org, which can be used to evaluate how well a plan with a particular parameterization will perform.

Our approach aims at complete plans, which run on a real robot and are, therefore, much more complex than those used in simulation. This requires an approach to structure plans such that they are easily introspected, which is presented in this paper. Additionally, running projection on a real robot during execution and integrating results of projection-based reasoning back into the executive poses another challenge, which has been tackled in this paper.\nPlan Architecture: To enable convenient performance introspection, plans have to be nicely structured, i.e. be modular, explicit and transparent. We have developed plans for fetching and delivering objects that have such a structure. In these plans, the control flow is separated from the reasoning necessary to ground entity descriptions into the environment at hand. The control flow of fetch is illustrated in Figure REF . {{figure:bfb352d3-14c3-4a",

We can test this by plotting the UV intensities against corresponding 100{{formula:f11ba89a-fa0b-4b68-ad54-243074632adf}} m IRAS background intensities, as shown in Figure 2. {{figure:c318888f-d1e2-4fd6-8c39-c8852a889ca1}}The IRAS background is correlated both with the dust column density and the density of the interstellar radiation field responsible for heating the grains along the line of sight. The steepening of the correlation suspected in Figure 1 should therefore be reduced; a residual effect could still result from the decrease of radiation density with z-distance from the galactic plane.In Figure 2, the intercept at zero IRAS intensity suggests a background of about 835 units, as suggested above.

We conclude the following:(1) We confirm that a major component of the measured UV background must be of Galactic origin based on its strong correlation with N(HI), with cosec{{formula:311af046-8944-4bae-800a-058acfbbec26}} , and with the IRAS 100{{formula:bead30a7-dce1-4588-9e2f-3dad34cc9bcf}} m background intensity.

The closeness of the correlation between DGL and far-IR background in Fig. 2 is marginally better (r = 0.93, Dorado omitted) than the correlation between DGL and HI in Figure 1 (r = 0.79); this may be understood through the fact that both DGL and IRAS 100{{formula:fcc0a895-d629-4fad-9209-6bc293354175}} m intensities depend directly on the dust column density, while the DGL-HI correlation involves a possibly variable gas-to-dust ratio. We must attribute the real width in the DGL distribution for a given IRAS intensity as resulting from variations due to phase function effects in the far-ultraviolet, which would leave the IRAS background unaffected, and from deviations of the line-of-sight cloud spectrum from the average (see §3.3.4).This initial examination of the FAUST data revealed that the measured diffuse background intensities consist of a constant component of at least 600 units and a DGL component which is correlated with other measures of the galactic dust column density and with the"

Compared to other methods, the Eulerian formulation offers a more straightforward and efficient way to reconstruct the director field, particularly when dealing with complex geometries and non-vanishing constant Gaussian curvature. Furthermore, the Lagrangean formulation of compatibility conditions provides a complementary approach that can be applied to any set of curvilinear coordinates, making it a valuable tool for analyzing director fields in various contexts.",

Instead we can calculate the director from knowledge of the curl and divergence fields and their gradients alone.The actual form of the compatibility conditions following this Eulerian formulation is very cumbersome and opaque, and only rarely admits an explicit solution. It may be useful for the specific cases where the bend and splay fields are given explicitly and one only seeks to find if they indeed describe a valid director field. In order to use the compatibility conditions to explicitly obtain a solution we formulate them using the director's natural coordinate system.\nLagrangean formulation of compatibility conditions: The vectorial formulation of the compatibility conditions appearing in the previous section can be applied to any set of curvilinear coordinates parameterizing the surface of Gaussian curvature {{formula:68b36cb7-91c8-49cc-ad01-0c4c69b926cf}} .

The gamma p reaction, specifically the gamma p to pi-zero pi-zero p process, is sensitive to chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) predictions, which attribute the reaction strength to pion loops in the 2pi-zero channel. The agreement between experimental data and ChPT calculations has significant implications for testing the theory and understanding the strong interaction.

After achieving nearly 100% attack success rates in white-box setting, more focus is shifted to black-box attacks, of which the transferability of adversarial examples has gained significant attention. In either case, the common gradient-based methods generally use the sign function to generate perturbations on the gradient update, that offers a roughly correct direction and has gained great success. But little work pays attention to its possible limitation. In this work, we observe that the deviation between the original gradient and the generated noise may lead to inaccurate gradient update estimation and suboptimal solutions for adversarial transferability. To this end, we propose a Sampling-based Fast Gradient Rescaling Method (S-FGRM). Specifically, we use data rescaling to substitute the sign function without extra computational cost. We further propose a Depth First Sampling method to eliminate the fluctuation of rescaling and stabilize the gradient update. Our method could be used in",

Specifically, we design a data rescaling method for the gradient calculation, that directly exploits the distribution of gradient values in different dimensions and maintains their disparities.

      "expected_output": "The impact of bin size on signal enhancement in reflective versus transmissive geometries reveals distinct differences. In transmissive geometries, the 1/e areas decrease with increasing number of bins, eventually reaching a steady state value. In contrast, reflective geometries exhibit an increase in 1/e areas with the number of bins, which is attributed to the use of a genetic algorithm. This discrepancy suggests that the choice of algorithm influences the optimization process. The genetic algorithm's ability to couple light into multiple modes as the target area increases leads to an enhancement that behaves as a stretched exponential function of bin numbers. In designing optimal experimental setups, consideration of the interplay between bin size, algorithm, and geometry is crucial. The use of a genetic algorithm in reflective geometries allows for greater coupling into multiple modes, resulting in increased 1/e areas. Furthermore, the spot size's inverse relationship with 1/e areas and the effect of sample position on the enhancement must be taken into account to optimize the experimental setup.",

However, the behavior of the 1/e areas is unexpected given their behavior perviously seen when in the transmissive geometry. In the case of optimized transmission, the 1/e areas were found to decrease with increasing number of bins, eventually reaching a steady state value .While more modeling and experiments are required to precisely determine the difference in the 1/e area behavior with bin number between the transmission study and the current study, we note that preliminary experimental results using the iterative algorithm suggest that the increasing 1/e area with number of bins is related to the use of a genetic algorithm. To understand why the choice of algorithm should influence the 1/e area we consider the underlying physics of optimization as a function of spot size.When considering optimization of a speckle pattern it is known that the average speckle size roughly correlates with a single reflection (transmission) mode , , . Therefore when optimizing an area on the order of a single speckle the optimization algorithm works to couple light into a single exit mode. As the target area increases the number of modes being optimized increases. This increase in the number of modes being optimized",
        " {{table:59e7e9ae-721e-454f-95c6-cdc0717b1cfb}}These results are consistent with previous measurements of optimized transmission using a genetic algorithm – where the enhancement behaved as a stretched exponential as a function of bin numbers – suggesting that the reflective geometry does not influence how the bin size affects the optimization. While there is consistency between optimized reflection and transmission using a genetic algorithm, the results differ from optimized transmission using an IA, which behaves as a single exponential . This implies that the difference in the optimization's dependence on bin size is due to the algorithm and not the geometry.\nSLM Cropping: Along with the bin size determining the total number of bins, the active side length {{formula:f41a9d9e-6139-4db0-bc0a-5f897ee21f4f}} , of the SLM also changes the number of active bins. To measure the enhancement's dependence on the active side length we use a spot size of {{formula:57e912a1-cc31-4807-9691-d6a4486ae642}} {{formula:440101d2-7517-",

However, for the Genetic algorithm the increase in {{formula:6cea3768-a738-4b3c-bdbf-067092953c92}} does not influence the optimization time, so the influence of decoherence and noise is unchanged. Additionally, the increase of {{formula:d2ae2ed8-0f14-4688-b962-70e6aeddd3ae}} allows for greater coupling into multiple modes, which results in the 1/e area increasing.Along with measuring the effect of bin size on the enhancement as a function of target area, we also consider the effect of spot size on the enhancement's functional behavior. From Table REF we find that there is an inverse relationship between the spot size and the 1/e areas, which can also be seen in Figure REF where the enhancement curves narrow as the spot size increases. This effect arises due to the Fourier relationship between the sample and detector planes.\nSample Position: Along with the SLM and detector parameters, the enhancement is also influenced by changing the beam-sample intersection. This is achieved by either moving the sample along the optical axis or rotating the sample"

Practical applications of this research include providing a low-cost solution for indoor service robots with limited sensor capabilities, such as lightweight sweeping robots.

        "world environment is the central challenge to transfer the trained model to a real robot directly. In this paper, we only used 10-dimensional sparse range findings as the observation input. This highly abstracted observation was sampled from specific angles of the raw laser range findings based on a trivial distribution. This brings two advantages: the first is the reduction of the gap between the virtual and real environments based on this abstracted observation, and the second is the potential extension to low-cost range sensors with distance information from only 10 directions.We list the main contributions of this paper: (1) A mapless motion planner was proposed by taking only 10-dimensional sparse range findings and target relative information as references. (2) The motion planner was trained end-to-end from scratch through an asynchronous deep-RL method. The planner can output continuous linear and angular velocities directly. (3) The learned planner can generalize to a real nonholonomic differential robot platform without any fine-tuning to real-world samples.\nDeep-Learning-based navigation: Benefiting from the improvement of high-performance computational hardware, deep neural networks show great potential for solving complex estimation problems.

Env-2 is much more aggressive with closer obstacles so that the robot can navigate in the complex real environment successfully.In this paper, we compared our deep learning trained model with the original and low-dimensional map-based motion planner. Compared with the trajectories of Move Base, the path generated from our planner is more tortuous. A possible explanation is that the network has neither the memory of the previous observation nor the long-term prediction ability. Thus LSTM and RNN are possible solutions for that problem. We set this revision as future work.However, we are not aiming to replace the map-based motion planner: it is obvious when the application scenario is a large-scale and complex environment, the map of the environment can always provide a reliable navigation path. Our target is to provide a low-cost solution for an indoor service robot with several range sensors, like a light-weight sweeping robot. The experiments showed that Move Base with sparse range findings can not be adapted to narrow indoor environments. Although we used the range findings from a laser sensor, it is certain that this 10-dimensional information can be replaced by low-cost range sensors.In addition, reinforcement learning methods provide a considerable online"

Such event causes a substantial obfuscation of the X-ray source due to the increased local absorption column density and the flares that are observed during the pointing are likely triggered by some part of this possibly structured clump onto the NS. Interestingly, the reported increases in the absorption column density during the rises of flares and the abrupt decreases close to the peaks are similar to what has been observed in the past in several SFXTs (BZ17) and interpreted as being due to the approaching of a clump (or some structures within it) to the neutron star (during the rises from the flare) and the photoionization of the clump material shortly after the flare has reached a sufficiently high luminosity (close to the peak). The significant anti-correlation between the count rate and the absorption covering fraction is a further indication that an increasing radiation tends to clear up wind clumps around the neutron star.

A clump passing in front of the NS without being accreted is expected to (at least partly) obscure the X-ray source and its presence can thus be revealed by the signature of photoelectric absorption. Clumps that are instead (at least partly) accreted by the NS lead to a temporarily larger mass accretion rate, giving rise to X-ray flares or outbursts characterized by an enhanced local absorption . Events of source dimming associated with the passages of clumps have been reported in several observations of SFXTs , , while a systematic investigation of the signatures of clumps during flares and outbursts of SFXTs has been presented by BZ17 exploiting all XMM-Newton observations available up to 2017. {{table:e5e15"

Clustering algorithms, such as K-means, and dimensionality reduction algorithms, like PCA and SVD, are sensitive to hyperparameters and may not preserve the underlying relationships in the data.

Most of the algorithms that were designed during that phase were based on probabilistic reasoning and statistics. Classical Models (Figure REF ) can be broadly classified into supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised Learning algorithms consist of the algorithms like SVMs , Logistic and Linear Regression. In contrast, Unsupervised Learning Algorithms consist of algorithms like clustering algorithms (K-means clustering , DBSCAN ) and dimensionality reduction algorithms (Principal Component Analysis , Singular Value Decomposition , Latent Dirichlet allocation , Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA , pLSA )). {{figure:2f94372f-6fd5-4f38-a009-7d08749a70ce}}Linear Regression is used for regression, i.e., predicting the continuous values, while Logistic Regression is used for classification.

SVMs choose the decision boundary that maximizes the distance from all the classes' nearest data points. SVMs are broadly classified into Simple SVM and Kernel-based SVMs, where simple SVM is used in the case where data is linearly separable, and Kernel SVMs are used when the dataset consists of non-linear data. Kernel SVMs use kernel functionsSome popular kernel functions include: Linear Kernel, Polynomial Kernel, Radial Basis Function Kernel to address the non-linearity in the data. Clustering and dimensionality reduction algorithms come under unsupervised learning algorithms. As the name suggests, clustering tries to group data samples with the same features into one cluster, for example, k-means clustering. In contrast, dimensionality reduction algorithms try to reduce the dimensions required to represent the same data sample with minimum loss in feature. After dimension reduction, performing the downstream task over the",

This transformation occurred in two phases; The Classical Machine Learning phase and The Modern Machine Learning phase. SVMs, Kernel Methods, Regression Techniques like Logistic and Linear Regression, Classification Techniques, and Tree-Based Methods all come under the traditional ML phase. In contrast, the Modern ML phase includes all the deep learning algorithms, such as GNNs, attention-based methods, and many more. The models that come under the classical learning phase can only capture the complex patterns in the table, thus making the model explainable. In contrast, the models used in the modern learning phase project tabular data into latent space in order to capture hidden properties and relations of the table. These models are more difficult to explain than traditional learning models.Researchers have examined the tabular data from a variety of lenses, as illustrated in Figure REF .

This is notable, considering our GPU-accelerated networks use the state-of-the-art Titan V GPU to execute OpenCL kernels, while the limited resources available on the utilized FPGA creates a large bottleneck on the maximum synthesizable frequency, and thus limits the speed of our FPGA-accelerated networks. We believe the shorter inference times observed are mainly due to the binarized parameters during inference, which accelerate the required computations. This also explains"

        " Section show that our boosting method can merge existing land cover classifications in a robust manner. Furthermore, it shows that we can generate an accurate uncertainty map of the boosted area, which is useful in the analysis of the boosted land cover map.In this section, we further investigate these results and describe the capabilities and advantages of our method for land cover boosting, as well as describe its shortfalls.\nComments on the effect of priors: Since priors are set based on expert knowledge and are subjective by nature, it is difficult to fully analyse the effect of various decisions on accuracy. However, we can make a few key observations based on the results we presented. From Figure REF , we can see that all scenarios which include all the datasets have similar accuracy. In contrast, scenario 3, which excludes OSM data altogether, has a slightly lower accuracy across many classes. However, the accuracy measure does not provide a complete picture of how this factor affects the overall boosted classification appearance. From Figure REF , we can see that the overall map confidence factor does not significantly change the final boosted classification. In contrast, class-wise confidence factors have a somewhat larger effect on the final booster classification – see Figures REF (d), REF (e), and REF (g",
        " As the OSM dataset for this region is significantly less sparse than for our test region, the confidence factor should have been adjusted upwards. Furthermore, the region contains large areas of cultivated land, which is known to be a source of conflict among CLC2006 and GlobeLand30. Thus, prior to boosting the land cover classification, expert knowledge should have been used to adjust the confidence factors and priors for the region.While class accuracy does not depict a large improvement over existing methods, the power of our proposed approach is in its ability to select and fuse the existing approaches in such a way as to have an overall better land cover classification than each of the individual land cover maps that were boosted. Furthermore, our approach can perform boosting in the presence of noisy, incomplete, and conflicting input data while preserving spatial consistency and producing an overall reasonable, detailed and still diverse land cover classification.\nComments on classification uncertainty: Perhaps one of the largest benefits of the proposed approach is that it provides the probability for each class occurring at each pixel. These class-wise probabilities can easily be exploited to generate uncertainty maps of the boosted land cover classification as well as for the original datasets. Due to the nature of the aerial imagery, which is often used to generate land cover classifications, inherent inter-",
        " need for strong expert priors to generate a reasonable land cover classification.Apart from the effect of priors, Table REF reveals that the inclusion of VGI has a positive effect on the overall accuracy of the final boosted classification. Thus, the inclusion of additional datasets, even if noisy and incomplete, might play a larger role in the overall accuracy than the configuration of priors.\nQualitative view of boosted classification accuracy: We compared the boosted classifications from our test scenarios over a diverse sub-section of our study area using a purely qualitative approach. In Figure REF , we can see the classification differences between our four test scenarios, the original land cover classifications and the ATKIS reference datums.Based on Figure REF it is clear how the inclusion of various datum as well as the selection of priors affect the overall boosting process. Furthermore, we can observe how our approach preserves spatial consistency between neighbouring classes even when the input data sources are noisy, conflicting or incomplete. This observation is particularly clear in scenario 4, Figure REF (g), where the river feature from the OSM dataset is included in the boosted classification, but the area around the feature remains spatially consistent with CLC2006 and GlobeLand30.Figure REF depicts another sub-region"

To make models memorize statements, we train until perplexity on the training data reaches 1.0 or does not improve for 20 epochs. For evaluation, we generate the target sequence – i.e., the answer to a given query – via a beam search with beam size 10. We measure perfect-match accuracy of the full entity name, i.e., there is no credit for partial token matches.The four models under comparison are now treated as sequence-to-sequence encoders and extended with a decoder of the same size: LSTM decoders for LSTM encoders (LSTM2LSTM) and randomly initialized Transformers for Transformer encoders (RoBERTa2Transformer, Transformer2Transformer).Unlike symbolic representation, surface representation can handle the entire set of 6 million Wikipedia entities.

As the results show (Fig. REF ), symbolic representation yields very high memorization accuracies with a vocabulary of 1 million entities. Randomly initialized RoBERTa-base without pretraining works best, memorizing 97 percent of 5 million statements correctly.Unfortunately, the softmax computation becomes prohibitively slow as the vocabulary size increases , making symbolic representation with a softmax over a vocabulary consisting of the full set of 6 million Wikipedia entities impractical. Imposing a hierarchy is a common approach for dealing with large vocabularies, but did not work well in this case (See Appx. REF ).\nSurface Form Representation: With surface form representation, each entity is represented by its canonical name.We use English Wikidata labels as canonical names. Since this name generally consists of more than one token, we cast memorizing statements and querying facts as a sequence-to-sequence task : Given the source sequence “Bert is a character on [MASK]”, the model should generate the target sequence “Sesame Street”.The [",
        " LM vocabulary size usually does not exceed 100k entries. How can millions of entities be represented in LMs? circumvent this problem by only considering 21k entities whose canonical name corresponds to a single token in the LM's vocabulary, e.g., entities like “France” or “Bert”, but not “United Kingdom” or “Sesame Street”. Hence, this approach cannot handle entities not contained in the vocabulary and a query like “Bert is a character on [MASK]” is not answerable in this simplified setting. To answer this first question, we compare three methods for scaling LM-as-KB to millions of entities:Symbolic representation, i.e., extending the LM vocabulary with entries for all entities; Surface form representation, i.e., each entity is represented by its subword-encoded canonical name, which is stored and queried by extending the LM with a sequence decoder; and Continuous representation, i.e., each entity is represented as an embedding.We find that, while all three entity representations allow LMs to store millions of world-knowledge facts involving a large number of entities, each representation comes with different trade-offs: Symbolic representation allows"

Nevertheless, these studies focus more on the effectiveness and efficiency of the model than on specific tasks, and the performances rely on the scale as well as the distribution of the data . In the meantime, learning the difference between outliers and normal samples cannot be done directly from the attributes, and the semantic meanings of the context should be considered. Taken medical fraud for example , some of the frauds are coding or charging mistakes which should be excluded, while others like excessive or irrelevant services are to be detected.Traditional detection methods in medical domain rely on experts' effort to manually identify the errors, which is expensive and of low efficiency. Meanwhile, most of the researches mainly focus on practice guide . With the developments in machine learning modeling, current approaches have been trying to achieve simple and expert-free detection. Schiff et al. improved clinical decision system with machine learning-based approach which generates useful alert for medication error. Later in 2017, they used outlier detection screening to help generate alerts for medication errors . However, the performance relies on MedAware system"

Activity on the smaller particles is applied according to the quorum sensing scheme, in which a smaller particle will be active for a persistence time if its local nearest neighbors are equal to or greater than a certain threshold value. We start with a passive glassy state of the system and apply activity to the smaller particles, which shows a nonmonotonous glassy character of the active particles with the persistence time of the active force, from its passive limit (zero activity). On the other hand, passive particles of the active-passive mixture phase separate at the intermediate persistence time of the active force, resulting in the hexatic-liquid and solid-liquid phases. Thus, our system shows three regimes as active glass, phase separation, and active liquid, as the persistence time increases from its smaller values. We show that the solidlike and hexatic phases consisting of passive large particles are stable due to the smaller momentum transfer from active to passive particles, compared to the higher persistence time where the",

Tracing the {{formula:cb572c33-ab1b-4ff3-bcd3-0acd745b232f}} properties of CS under large gauge transformations shows it changes by a winding number so that its coefficient is necessarily integer; this is the dimensionless combination {{formula:8ecfb5d5-9bb9-4173-829b-fae4dd7e389e}} where {{formula:b6ad934c-9bd",
        " because physics in this planar world may even have observable consequences, in condensed matter settings as well as in high temperature limits of our D=4 world. Most of all, the interest was due to the fact that CS is here quadratic, {{formula:af4fb8ec-d1f0-4d62-8539-badf9d0ca51c}} and hence can affect free-field (Maxwell) electromagnetism, and indeed lead to a finite-range but still gauge-invariant model. In its nonabelian incarnation, where {{formula:bce4f6a3-7b74-439a-88ae-07cc735bbd00}} is a Lie-algebra valued 1-form, the term has the remarkable property that its numerical coefficient must be quantized for the quantum theory to be well-defined . This idea, coming entirely from homotopy analysis, was of course a revelation to physicists on how a priori arbitrary parameters could in fact be restricted in their possible values (and hence had better also be renormalized by integer amounts only).Before we consider some of the novel consequences of CS in this D=3 context, we first mention",

It is known that the naive CS term {{formula:75d88308-6799-4f17-89f5-53c059d9823b}} now requires corrections to remain well-defined. These corrections to CS, and its behavior under large (not reducible to the identity) gauge transformations can in fact be elucidated in two complementary ways, (and different from the known cohomology procedures cited in ). The first uses a really “classic\" result, the Chern–Weil theorem, which in D=4 tells us (using the transgression formula) that for two different connections {{formula:9bb0de07-b273-4f63-bc79-a278e482891e}} on a bundle, {{formula:c321fc36-b019-49b6-9777-"

[Objective] However, how an environment configuration impacts the variability of these systems is yet to be explored. Understanding and quantifying the degree of variability due to such configurations can help practitioners decide the best environment configuration for the most stable AI products. [Method] To achieve this goal, we performed experiments with eight different combinations of three key environment variables (operating system, Python version, and CPU architecture) on 30 open-source AI-based systems using the Travis CI platform. We evaluate variability using three metrics: the output of an AI component like an ML model (performance), the time required to build and run a system (processing time), and the cost associated with building and running a system (expense). [Results] Our results indicate that variability exists in all three metrics; however, it is observed more frequently with respect to processing time and expense than performance. For example, between Linux and MacOS, variabilities are observed in 23",

We provide empirical evidence on the effect of different environment configurations on the variability of AI-based systems. We make our data and scripts available for reproducibility and future research .The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Background and research methodology are described in Section . In Sections , , and , we present the results and findings of our analysis for each research question. Sections , present discussion and threats to validity respectively followed by Section in which we talk about existing works. Finally, in Section , we summarize our findings and conclude the paper by describing potential future directions of research.\nMethodology and Background: To be able to conduct our experiments in different development environment configurations, we use Travis CI — a widely used Continuous Integration (CI) platform . The reason for choosing Travis CI is that a recent study on the usage of CI tools in ML projects reports that Travis CI is the most popular among open-source software (OSS) developers for building AI-based systems .\nEnvironment Configurations in Travis CI: In this study, the three configuration variables we experiment with are Operating System, CPU Architecture, and Python Version.",
        " systems, versions of a programming language and associated libraries, and hardware configurations, can depend on many factors including developers' experience, business needs, and existing environment configurations of legacy systems. However, these choices may potentially induce variability in the performance of AI/ML models as “practitioners' degrees of freedom” , , which is a known issue in the field of applied statistics. However, in the domain of software engineering, no existing work studies the potential sources of variability in AI-based software from an environment configuration perspective. In this paper, we aim to address this issue by answering the following three research questions:RQ1: (Operating System) To what extent does the operating system induce variability in AI-based systems? We analyze whether variations in operating systems make AI-based systems behave differently. We find that variability in performance is observed in 23% of the projects between Linux and MacOS whereas 20% of the projects show such variability between Linux and Windows. Almost all projects show significant variability in processing time and expense between different operating systems. RQ2: (Python Version) How does the Python version contribute to the variability in AI-based systems? We investigate the effect of Python versions on the behavior of AI-based systems.

Euclidean distance is a commonly used similarity measure, but more sophisticated methods, such as those taking uncertainties into account, can yield better results. The choice of similarity measure affects the experimental design, as it influences the selection of training data and the optimization of model parameters. Furthermore, the similarity measure can impact the theoretical contributions of RSBAL detection models, as it can inform the development of new models or the refinement of existing ones. For instance, a similarity measure that effectively captures the nuances of redshifted broad absorption lines can lead to improved detection accuracy and a deeper understanding of the underlying astrophysical processes. In the context of RSBAL detection, the authors found that dimensionality reduction techniques, such as t-SNE, were not effective, suggesting that the features of interest are not dominant in quasar spectra. Therefore, the selection of an appropriate similarity measure is crucial for the development of accurate and robust RSBAL detection models.",

Here we do not need a physical model of the objects of interest. Instead a sample of known examples is used to train a classifier to recognize these objects. The classifier is then applied to the rest of the data in order to find additional objects of the same type. This approach was applied for example in , in which a deep Convolutional Neural Network was trained to detect DLAs. is an example for a comparison of all of the above methods, including visual inspection, in the context of finding strong gravitational lenses in images. It is interesting to note that they find automated tools (such as Convolutional Neural Network and Support Vector Machine) to perform better than visual inspection in some aspects.Another method, which we apply in this work, is similarity based object retrieval (also called nearest neighbors search). With this method one calculates a pair-wise similarity between the objects in the dataset. Starting with a sample of objects of a given type, the similarities allow us to enlarge the sample by finding similar objects in the rest of the data. The similarity based method has the advantage that it is 'cheap',",
        " by finding similar objects in the rest of the data. The similarity based method has the advantage that it is 'cheap', meaning the similarity matrix only needs to be calculated once, and could then be applied to all object types (in contrast to the need to develop a different model, or train a new classifier, for every object type). In addition, we can start looking for similar objects given a single example, while with training a detector one usually needs a significant amount of examples in order to avoid issues that arise from imbalanced training sets. The different methods could also be complementary, for example one could first do a similarity search to build a large sample, and follow that with training a detector.We note that similarity based object retrieval is sometimes performed in combination with dimensionality reduction tools such as self organizing maps and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding . In such applications a dimensionality reduction tool is applied to the data, and the similarity is calculated in the lower dimensional space. Examples for applications of these techniques in astronomy are , which created a SOM of SDSS quasars, and detected additional examples of various types of unusual quasars.

        " quasars. In an application of t-SNE to APOGEE infrared stellar spectra enabled detection of previously unknown B-type emission line stars. For our current goal of detecting RSBALs, we find that dimensionality reduction is not an effective technique (we tried using t-SNE for this purpose). We suggest that this is because the features we are interested in here, i.e, the redshifted broad absorption line, are not dominant features in quasars spectra (compared to the continuum shape and emission lines properties). Dimensionality reduction can discard information about such less dominant features.\nSimilarity based object retrieval: In this section we discuss different measures for similarity between two spectra, as well as different approaches for using these similarities for object retrieval.\nSimilarity measures: The first step in similarity based data mining is deciding on a way to measure similarity between objects in the data. The most natural and commonly used similarity measure is euclidian distance (or {{formula:d0ebf15e-3a44-406f-90fb-1313ca34219c}} , taking uncertainties into account). Although euclidian distance can be a competitive approach, more sophisticated methods produce better results for various datasets"

Unlike Prompt Diffusion, our model does not require paired context examples, but just one or more “target\" context images serving as examples of the desired output and a single query image providing visual structure. The reason for using target examples as context is that the source images are derived from the target itself and do not provide any additional information for the task.

It builds on the popular ControlNet model which introduced the idea of visually controllable diffusion models for image generation. Specifically, Prompt Diffusion attempts to learn the visual mapping from the source image to the target context image and applies it to a new query image, by also using a prompt for text-based guidance. However, we empirically observed that this model struggles to leverage the image pairs when the text prompt is absent. This results in low fidelity to the visual context examples, particularly when the examples are from a different domain than what is seen during training.

Moreover, Raman amplifiers can be used in discrete or distributed stand–alone configurations to provide ultra-wideband gain , . The suitable selection of pump powers and wavelengths is the key in achieving a desired Raman gain profile. This is a challenging task as the relationship between gain profile versus pump powers and wavelengths is nonlinear and requires extensive numerical simulations to predict, especially for a large number of pumps .Recently, a machine learning (ML)–based framework for Raman amplifier design has been proposed , . The advantage of the proposed framework in , is that it can provide an ultra–fast and low–complexity pump powers and wavelengths allocation for the design of arbitrary Raman gain profiles.In this paper, extensive experimental investigations of the framework proposed by , are presented.

The accuracy of the ML–based framework in predicting the pump powers to provide a set of arbitrary gain profiles is investigated by comparing the target gain profiles with the profiles experimentally obtained when applying the pump powers predicted by the framework. A vast statistically analysis of several thousand cases is conducted and error distributions are estimated showing that the ML-based framework proposed in , can effectively design Raman amplifier with limited errors.Even though experimental results are shown only for the C–band in this paper, because of limitation in the available Raman pump wavelengths, we believe that main conclusions can be extended to larger bandwidth, i.e. C+L, as we have shown by simulation in .\nExperimental setup: Fig.REF shows the experimental setup used to generate the data–set for the ML–based Raman amplifier design. The input signal is emulated by an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) source covering the entire C–band (192-196 THz). Its profile is also depicted in Fig.REF .

We quantify this in §4, below.\nApplication to the LOSS-SDSS Sample: We now apply our method to the SN survey data obtained by considering all LOSS galaxies with SFHs based on spectroscopy from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). First, we summarize briefly the essentials of each of these surveys and of the sample resulting from their intersection.\nThe Lick Observatory SN Search: The LOSS is an ongoing survey for SNe in a sample of {{formula:a23e54af-9ab5-48ca-bc26-f0d7df5ad1c5}} 15,000 nearby (redshift {{formula:f5129397-014d-432f-9ce2-272d75d086e6}} ) galaxies, conducted with the Katzman",

For the DTD in these simulations, we have taken a {{formula:3ebec42f-e06a-4e39-81f4-445a8f97c119}} dependence (which is roughly generic to DD models; see §REF , above), scaled so as to give the desired total number of SNe using the LOSS visibility times. The simulations show that surveys with several hundred SNe enable reasonably good DTD recovery in terms of both accuracy and temporal resolution. Specifically, Figure REF demonstrates that already-existing SN surveys, and LOSS in particular, have the power to measure reliably the SN Ia DTD, if the SFHs could be estimated in a comprehensive and unbiased way for the full sample of {{formula:6cdc2c3c-18de-431d-b8d5-a8caed03fa01}} galaxies. We briefly discuss the prospects for this in the concluding section, below.We have gauged the effect of the time binning on the time integral over the DTD, {{formula:7b491c8d-555c-4eb",
        "a110d}} of the cases.The above approach for recovering the DTD has several advantages over previous methods. First, all of the known information in the survey is included in the analysis in a statistically rigourous way, including the fact that many (usually most) of the galaxies did not host any SNe. Furthermore, the calculation is easily generalized to cases where the galaxies are not all at the same distances (e.g., combinations of surveys done at different redshifts) – one simply needs to use the appropriate SFH bins and visibility times for every galaxy. In fact, assuming that the DTD is a universal function, it is straightforward to include in a single analysis the data from completely disparate SN surveys. For example, one could combine the results of normal SN surveys with unconventional SN “surveys,” in which the SN rate is measured based on SN remnants in small subunits of a few nearby galaxies (Maoz & Badenes 2010).The number and resolution of the time bins used in the analysis will naturally depend on the quality of the data.

A famous trend to overcome this issue is to focus on subclasses of alternant/Goppa codes with a non trivial automorphism group. Such codes display then symmetries allowing compact parity-check or generator matrices. For instance, a key-reduction is obtained by taking quasi-cyclic (QC) or quasi-dyadic (QD) alternant/Goppa codes.

However, its limitations, such as the assumption of a simple ground state and the neglect of non-perturbative effects, impact the ability to make precise predictions about quark-gluon plasma behavior. Renormalization toward the Fermi surface is a crucial aspect of this approximation, allowing for the effective interactions in the dense medium to be related to the fundamental interactions in the perturbative vacuum.

The system LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$ was shown to exhibit typical kagome band structure features near the Fermi energy formed by the Ru-$dz^{2}$ orbitals and the highest superconducting transition temperature $T_{\\rm c}$ ${\\simeq}$ 7K among the kagome-lattice materials. However, the effect of electronic correlations on the normal state properties remains elusive. Here, we report the discovery of charge order in La(Ru$_{1-x}$Fe$_{x}$)$_{3}$Si$_{2}$ ($x$ = 0, 0.01, 0",

Namely, single crystal X-ray diffraction reveals charge order with a propagation vector of ($\\frac{1}{4}$,0,0) below $T_{\\rm CO-I}$ ${\\simeq}$ 400K in all three compounds. At lower temperatures, we see the appearance of a second set of charge order peaks with a propagation vector of ($\\frac{1}{6}$,0,0). The introduction of Fe, which is known to quickly suppress superconductivity, does not drastically alter the onset temperature for charge order. Instead, it broadens the scattered intensity such that diffuse scattering appears at the same onset temperature, however does not coalesce into sharp Bragg diffraction peaks until much lower in temperature. Our results present the first example of a charge ordered state at or above room temperature in the correlated kagome lattice with bulk superconductivity.\nMETHODS: Sample preparation: The samples of La(Ru_{1-x}Fe_{x})_{3}Si_{2} were synthesized from high-purity Si lump",

The effective focal length of the eyes is adjusted by a change in the shape of the human crystalline lens controlled by ciliary muscles. This process is called accommodation and the distance where the eyes are focused is called accommodation depth . {{figure:d291d4a9-c01c-4854-aa76-16d7fa14e35a}}In addition, eyes converge to fixate upon points in space",

Accommodation and vergence responses follow each other. Even if they follow each other, there are some mismatches in some cases. This is called vergence-accommodation conflict (VAC) . So, even if accommodation is somehow predicted by vergence information, there are mismatch cases like 3D films and monocular applications. In ophthalmology, eye accommodation depth is measured for various applications such as the diagnosis of presbyopia and anisometropic amblyopia.In this work, we developed a prototype device for dynamic gaze and accommodation measurements based on 4 Purkinje reflections (PR) suitable for use in AR and ophthalmology applications.

The leading order NNPDF2.3QED fit is the new default PDF set in Pythia 8, used in the recent Monash tune .The NNPDF3.0 analysis represents a major upgrade. First of all, the fit is based on a more efficient code completely rewritten in c++. Most importantly, over a thousand new data points are analysed, both from HERA II and from the LHC. The significant increase in the number of experimental data is accompanied by a refined fitting methodology both based on and validated by a statistical closure",

The NNPDF2.3 fit was the first PDF determination including the effect of the early LHC data. Here the new NNPDF3.0 PDF set is announced and its main features are presented. The novel NNPDF analysis is based on an improved fitting methodology, statistically validated by closure tests. Over a thousand new data points are included, both the recent HERA II measurements and a wide set of new LHC data. In this contribution details on the experimental data are given and their impact on PDF uncertainties is displayed.\nIntroduction: Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) play a crucial role in the LHC physics program. The PDF error is the dominant source of theoretical uncertainty for several key processes at the LHC, and therefore it limits the accuracy of both SM analyses, such as the characterisation of the Higgs boson, and BSM searches, particularly those involving heavy particles in the final state. The excellent performance of the L",

In the past few months, several new measurements have been made available by the LHC experiments, based on a larger statistic sample and with smaller systematic uncertainties. They are expected to provide a unique handle on PDFs. On top of the vector boson production data from ATLAS, LHCb and CMS that were already present in NNPDF2.3 we include: the ATLAS high-mass Drell-Yan production data, based on an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb{{formula:28ad2cf7-319f-4bae-8f22-a681927bed43}} , which give important information on the large-{{formula:fcea78da-afc2-4b8a-ad8d-d0ff5196d898}} quark-antiquark separation; the transverse momentum distribution of {{formula:7268ea68-edc0-4fa0-ade6-8bc3feab1b24}} bosons measured by ATLAS, which we expect to provide a complementary constraint on the gluon in the medium-"

Her view can be classified as an intermediate position between that of Albert and that of Hemmo and Shenker. Like Albert (and unlike Hemmo and Shenker), she sees the origin of irreversibility in a stochastic quantum dynamics that violates the standard Schrödinger time evolution. However, like Hemmo and Shenker (and unlike Albert), she attributes this stochasticity to interactions of a quantum system with the environment. Finally, has argued, within an Everettian framework, that the probabilities of statistical mechanics can be understood as arising from quantum-mechanical probabilities based on the fact that the classical limit of quantum mechanics is approximately isomorphic to a theory of classical probability distributions (as is evident from the Wigner function picture).\nNumerical experiments: To test Albert's proposal, we have performed simulations of a many-particle quantum system with and without GRW collapses.

        " the literature that Albert's theory, on which we focus here, is related to. This allows to see our results in a more general context.In contrast to the GRW theory, decoherence does by itself neither provide a solution to the measurement problem nor produce stochasticity. However, it is an important ingredient in various interpretations of quantum mechanics . This has been exploited in an explanation of the approach to equilibrium proposed by Hemmo and Shenker , , . Like Albert's idea, it is based on explaining probabilities in statistical mechanics based on quantum-mechanical probabilities. However, they take as a starting point not GRW theory, but no-collapse interpretations (such as modal interpretations or the Everett interpretation), in which a collapse of the wavefunction does not occur. Since the quantum dynamics of closed systems is isolated in the absence of collapses, stochasticity then requires external interventions. Thus, the proposal discussed in this section belongs to the tradition of interventionism , , , which explains the approach to equilibrium based on external perturbations.We discuss the approach following Ref. . In decoherence theory, one typically assumes that the initial state {{formula:1ac92178-1dd2-4e2a-ac5f",

However, it is only based on a qualitative argument, a quantitative test is lacking at present. Such a test would be required to see how far GRW collapses can actually get us on the road to equilibrium .A simple argument for Albert's proposal can be developed based on grwfokkermany. As is well known, the Boltzmann equation provides a useful model for the approach to thermodynamic equilibrium.

A notable exception is of course the limit of two-dimensional flows for which the inverse cascade of energy leads to a negative flux of energy that excites scales larger than the forcing scale.Many flows of geophysical or astrophysical interest far from the two-dimensional limit involve spatial structures at scales larger than the forcing scale. At these scales, no energy flux is expected and the usual Kolmogorov cascade picture does not hold. This is also true for some flows involved in industrial processes, such as large scale turbulent mixing. Dynamical and statistical properties of the zero flux solutions in scales larger than the forcing scale could thus be of interest for many applications in three-dimensional hydrodynamic turbulence.Despite the lack of quantitative studies of the large scales in three-dimensional statistically stationary turbulence, it has been believed since a long time that the scales larger than the forcing scale are in statistical equilibrium (see page 209 of reference ). The argument is that the energy driving the flow is transferred from the forcing scale {{formula:fa052206-d507-45da-8cf0-2c8f50ed9afb}} to the dissipation scale {{"

Existing AND methods can be divided into two categories: the models focusing on content information to distinguish whether two papers are written by the same author, the models focusing on relation information to represent information as edges on the network and to quantify the similarity among papers. However, the former requires adequate labeled samples and informative negative samples, and are also ineffective in measuring the high-order connections among papers, while the latter needs complicated feature engineering or supervision to construct the network. We propose a novel generative adversarial framework to grow the two categories of models together: (i) the discriminative module distinguishes whether two papers are from the same author, and (ii) the generative module selects possibly homogeneous papers directly from the heterogeneous information network, which eliminates the complicated feature engineering. In such a way, the discriminative module guides the generative module to select homogeneous papers, and the generative module generates high-quality negative samples to train the discriminative"

        " the cFM reported in Ref. 12, is accompanied/driven by an orbital order.Motivated by the cFM order detected in NMR experiments, here we investigated BNOO's orbital ordering pattern from first principles. We found two-sublattice orbital ordering, illustrated by the spin density plots, within the alternating planes in which the total magnetic moment resides. An auxiliary signature of the orbital ordering is revealed by the occupancies of the {{formula:759e5ad5-a87b-4d5e-a6f2-b25459872d1c}} orbitals in the density of states and band structures. Our first principles work demonstrates that this two-sublattice orbital ordering mainly arises from cFM order and strong SOC. Moving forward, it would be worthwhile to more thoroughly investigate the cFM order observed in this work using other functionals or methods more adept at handling strong correlation to eliminate any ambiguities that stem from our specific computational treatment.\nAcknowledgments: The authors thank Jeong-Pil Song and Yiou Zhang for enlightening discussions.

Additionally, we explore domain-based heterogeneity in clients' local datasets - a realistic Federated DG scenario. Prior Federated DG evaluations are limited in terms of the number or heterogeneity of clients and dataset diversity. To address this gap, we propose an Federated DG benchmark methodology that enables control of the number and heterogeneity of clients and provides metrics for dataset difficulty. We then apply our methodology to evaluate 14 Federated DG methods, which include centralized DG methods adapted to the FL context, FL methods that handle client heterogeneity, and methods designed specifically for Federated DG. Our results suggest that despite some progress, there remain significant performance gaps in Federated DG particularly when evaluating with a large number of clients, high client heterogeneity, or more realistic datasets.

However, the Hamiltonian operator commutes with local gauge transformations at each site on the lattice. Since these operators commute among themselves, the Hilbert space is split into subspaces characterized by the color charge at each site. In particular, the vacuum subspace has zero color at every site.Writing a general wave function belonging to a specific subspace is a nontrivial task.

      "expected_output": "The Two-State Vector Formalism (TSVF) theoretically contributes to resolving quantum system controversies by utilizing forward and backward evolving wavefunctions to describe the behavior of particles between two strong measurements. The forward evolving wavefunction represents the particle's evolution from the pre-selection, while the backward evolving wavefunction represents the evolution from the post-selection. This approach provides a framework for understanding counterfactual predictions and interaction-free measurements. However, limitations arise from the interpretation of the wavefunctions, particularly in nested Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) systems, where controversies surrounding the particle's path have sparked debate. Experimentally, TSVF can be designed using quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements to reveal the past of a quantum particle without disturbing the system's interference. Future research directions include exploring the application of TSVF in weak measurements, counterfactual communication, and interaction-free measurement technologies, which may lead to breakthroughs in quantum information processing and quantum communication.

The TSVF makes use of the forward and backward evolving wavefunctions, starting at the time of the pre-selection and at the time of the postselection, respectively. The authors who put forward the TSVF , , claimed in that “the particle was in the overlap of the forward and backward evolving quantum states”. Based on this claim, they stated for the nested Mach-Zanhder interferometer (MZI) that,“we can state the following: the photon did not enter the (inner) interferometer, the photon never left the interferometer, but it was there” . This statement raised serious controversies and led to considerable debate , . Recently, an experiment was reported where the authors said,“The experimental results have",
        " Eq. (REF ), we can clearly see that if the single photon evolves back to the pre-selection, so does the coherent state, which means the single photon leaves no trace in the inner interferometer (and on the measurement device).

The second term is the result of the corresponding single photon that leaves a trace in the inner interferometer and then goes away, and will not reach the source S. Hence, the backward evolving wavefucntion tells the same story as the forward evolving wavefunction. A particle going back from the detector D to the source S can not leave a trace inside the inner interferometer.In above, we propose an ideal experiment for the nested MZI system. In the experiment, the quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements are used to reveal the past of the quantum particle without disturbing the interference of the system (keeping the dark port still dark), which are different from the weak measurement in , that disturbs"

We believe that they are reasonable strategies for evaluating representations learned by a model, but future work is required to establish their use in practice.The policy aims to select the nearest examples in each class, therefore limiting the decision problem to a small region around the test example. We hope this policy allow human users to zoom in the local neighborhood and scrutinize the difference between the relatively close examples.

Despite the promising performance of supervised learning, representations learned by supervised models may not align well with human intuitions: what models consider as similar examples can be perceived as distinct by humans. As a result, they have limited effectiveness in case-based decision support. In this work, we incorporate ideas from metric learning with supervised learning to examine the importance of alignment for effective decision support. In addition to instance-level labels, we use human-provided triplet judgments to learn human-compatible decision-focused representations. Using both synthetic data and human subject experiments in multiple classification tasks, we demonstrate that such representation is better aligned with human perception than representation solely optimized for classification. Human-compatible representations identify nearest neighbors that are perceived as more similar by humans and allow humans to make more accurate predictions, leading to substantial improvements in human decision accuracies (17.8% in butterfly vs. moth classification and 13.2% in pneumonia classification).\nAcknowledgments: We thank the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments."

Research has shown that different dark matter halo profiles, such as the Hernquist, Navarro-Frenk-White, and pseudo-isothermal profiles, can affect the metric function and the condition for horizon formation. For instance, the metric function f(r) = 1 - 2M/r - 4πr_s^3(r_s+2r)ρ_s/3(r_s+r)^2, which describes a composite dark matter-BH system, indicates that the central density of the dark matter halo can significantly influence the existence of black hole horizons. The horizons can be determined by the condition f(r) = 0, and it has been found that there exists a unique horizon for each combination of dark matter halo parameters ρ_s and r_s. These effects have important implications for our understanding of cosmological structures, as they can impact the growth and evolution of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies, as well as the distribution of dark matter within these galaxies.

As DL often requires several hours to days for its training, HP optimization (HPO) of DL is often prohibitively expensive. This boosted the emergence of tabular or surrogate benchmarks, which enable querying the (predictive) performance of DL with a specific HP configuration in a fraction. However, since the actual runtime of a DL training is significantly different from its query response time, simulators of an asynchronous HPO, e.g. multi-fidelity optimization, must wait for the actual runtime at each iteration in a na\\\"ive implementation; otherwise, the evaluation order during simulation does not match with the real experiment. To ease this issue, we developed a Python wrapper and describe its usage. This wrapper forces each worker to wait so that we yield exactly the same evaluation order as in the real experiment with only $10^{-2}$ seconds of waiting instead of waiting several hours.

These methods have advantages compared with common Fourier techniques concerning their inherent stationarity and physical background. If autoregressive models are used, however, it has to be taken into account that real data always contain observational noise often obscuring the intrinsic time series of the object. We apply the technique of a Linear State Space Model which explicitly models the noise of astronomical data and allows to estimate the hidden autoregressive process. As an example, we have analysed a sample of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) observed with EXOSAT and found evidence for a relationship between the relaxation timescale and the spectral hardness.\nIntroduction and Mathematical Background: Irregular X-ray variability is a common phenomenon of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). The power spectra of the observed lightcurves exhibit an `observational noise floor' at high frequencies, an increase of power towards low frequencies ({{formula:971a3018-ae02-4960",

We use the lightcurve of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 5506 as an example for a brief description of how to apply LSSM and interpret LSSM results. We have found that the X-ray lightcurve of NGC 5506 can be well modelled with a LSSM AR[1] model, since the residuals between the estimated AR[1] process and the measured data are consistent with Gaussian white noise. The corresponding dynamical parameter of the LSSM AR[1] fit corresponds to a relaxation time of about 1.6 hours. Higher order LSSM AR[p] models cannot improve the fits significantly. Therefore more complex models (with additional relaxators and damped oscillators) are not needed to describe the dynamics of the AGN lightcurve. In addition, an AR[1] model provides all features occuring in AGN power spectra, especially the flat top at low frequencies which cannot be described by the {{formula:0ea10ff5-efba-4011-ba1e-ea"

Despite the effectiveness of Euclidean space for graph-related learning tasks, its ability to encode complex patterns is intrinsically limited by its polynomially expanding capacity. Although nonlinear techniques assist to mitigate this issue, complex graph patterns may still need an embedding dimensionality that is computationally intractable.

Recently, hyperbolic spaces have emerged as a promising alternative for processing graph data with tree-like structure or power-law distribution, owing to the exponential growth property. Different from Euclidean space, which expands polynomially, the hyperbolic space grows exponentially which makes it gains natural advantages in abstracting tree-like or scale-free graphs with hierarchical organizations. In this tutorial, we aim to give an introduction to this emerging field of graph representation learning with the express purpose of being accessible to all audiences. We first give a brief introduction to graph representation learning as well as some preliminary Riemannian and hyperbolic geometry. We then comprehensively revisit the hyperbolic embedding techniques, including hyperbolic shallow models and hyperbolic neural networks. In addition, we introduce the technical details of the current",

By modeling the interval between transits as a constant plus a sinusoidal function of time, researchers can effectively capture periodic variations in transit timings, which are crucial for understanding planetary orbits and system dynamics. The iterative process of fitting the model to the data, folding the data, and refining the sinusoidal component of the ephemeris allows for precise determination of transit timings and their uncertainties. The application of this method to Kepler-65 has revealed a significant TTV signal for Kepler-65d, indicating a complex orbital dynamics that can inform our understanding of the system's architecture and evolution. The accuracy of TTV analysis is further enhanced by correcting for correlated noise and low signal-to-noise ratios, as demonstrated in the case of Kepler-65.

To measure individual transit times for each planet we employed a phase-folded light curve as a template function. Specifically we used a phase-folded light curve that was obtained by fitting all of the transits under the assumption of a circular orbit with a constant period. The template was then fitted to the data from each transit observed at SC, with three free parameters: the central time of the transit, the out-of-transit flux level, and a constant gradient in the out-of-transit flux level. An MCMC code was used to obtain the posterior distribution for the time of transit. Since no SC data were available in Q0, Q1, or Q2, for those quarters we used the transit times from the Kepler TTV catalog (Rowe et al., in preparation), measured as described by Ford et al. (2011).The individual transit times were then fitted with a linear function of epoch, and this function was subtracted from the timing data to isolate any timing residuals. A visual inspection showed no obvious TTV signal in the residuals. We fitted these residuals with"

This relationship has significantly influenced the development of modern physics and measurement standards by enabling precise and consistent measurements across various fields, including optics, electromagnetism, and particle physics. The use of the speed of light as a reference point has also facilitated the development of advanced technologies, such as fiber optic communications and GPS systems, which rely on accurate distance and time measurements.

We have learned an interesting circular story of a unit of length that begins and ends with the second. At the beginning the unit of length was bound to the second by gravitational acceleration, taken at a reference point on the Earth's surface. Now the meter is bound to the second by the speed of light. In between (and somehow in parallel, at the very beginning) there have been the several attempts to define “a unit of length that does not depend on any other quantity” All English quotes not referring to English bibliography are translation by the authors. : initially from the size of Earth; then from a conventional platinum bar; finally from the wavelength of a well defined electromagnetic radiation.The recent relationship between the meter and the second is quite well known. Much less known is the fact that, just before the French Academy definition of the meter as a fraction of the Earth meridian, most scientists had considered the length of the pendulum that beats the second to be the most suitable unit of length. That consensus had steadily increased during the 18th century. However, in spring 1791 there was a metrological revolution inside the French Revolution.",
        " later against the meter. Though his figure is often presented as conservative, for his opposition to the meter, we have to admit that Lalande was quite right in proposing to base the unit of length on a physical standard, like the Paris toise, rather than on the size of Earth. This is exactly what happened one century later, when in 1889, having metrologists realized that a practical unit based on Earth was not accurately reproducible as required for precision measurements and, most important, the definition itself was basically flawed, as we shall see at the end of this paper. The definition of the unit of length was then solely based upon the platinum standard, with no reference to Earth any more. Perhaps what Lalande underestimated was the psychological driving force of standards taken from nature that, with all the problems he correctly spotted (see Ref. ), was crucial to reach, soon or later, some national and international agreement. This is the reason that led several scientists and thinkers to seek for units that were not just as arbitrary as any materialization of the parts of the human body. Standards `taken from nature' (“pris dans la nature” ) were then seen as a possible chance to achieve a reform of units of measurements acceptable to all citizens of the",
        " dimensions of Earth, together with a reasonable decimal sub-multiple as practical unit. {{table:2dba666c-b364-47ab-9987-8e3969affed1}}Sub-multiples of the length of the meridian, e.g. one part over 10 000 000 or one part over 100 000 000, had led to a `meter' of 400 or 40 of `our' centimeters. The former is certainly too large, but the latter is quite appropriate for daily use, and, indeed, it falls in a range of length that is better perceived by people (one of the criticisms to the meter is its unnaturality, at least compared for example to the foot or even to the first standardized unit, the cubit). Even the pole-to-pole arc would have yield a better practical unit, very close to the toise.We see from table REF that the 10 000 000 part of the quarter of meridian is the closest to the length of the seconds pendulum. So, when the French scientists proposed the new unit of length, we think it is possible, among the many `defensible natural units', they chose the closest to the seconds pendulum.

We identify both the continuum version of the linear simplicity constraints used in the quantum discrete context and a linear version of the quadratic volume constraints that are necessary to complete the reduction from the topological theory to gravity. We illustrate and discuss also the discrete counterpart of the same continuum linear constraints. Moreover, we show under which additional conditions the discrete volume constraints follow from the simplicity constraints, thus playing the role of secondary constraints. Our analysis clarifies how the discrete constructions of spin foam models are related to a continuum theory with an action principle that is equivalent to general relativity.\nMotivation: As is well known, general relativity in three dimensions is topological, as there are no local degrees of freedom.

Recent advances in automated scoring often leverage textual representations based on pre-trained language models such as BERT and GPT as input to scoring models. Most existing approaches train a separate model for each item/question, which is suitable for scenarios such as essay scoring where items can be quite different from one another. However, these approaches have two limitations: 1) they fail to leverage item linkage for scenarios such as reading comprehension where multiple items may share a reading passage; 2) they are not scalable since storing one model per item becomes difficult when models have a large number of parameters. In this paper, we report our (grand prize-winning) solution to the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) automated scoring challenge for reading comprehension.

        "# arXiv Paper: 1910.05694\n\nWhat are temporal correlations\nabstract: Space and time are crucial twins in physics. In quantum mechanics, spatial correlations already reveal nonclassical features, such as entanglement, and have bred many quantum technologies. However, the nature of quantum temporal correlations still remains in vague. In this Letter, based on the entangled-history formalism, we prove rigorously that temporal correlations are equivalent to spatial correlations. The effect of temporal correlations corresponds to a quantum channel. The resulting quantifications and classifications of quantum temporal correlations are illustrated in a natural way. Our proposed procedures also show how to determine temporal correlations completely.\n: What are Quantum Temporal Correlations?

The white noise assumption is crucial in ensuring that the noise process is uncorrelated and has a constant power spectral density, which is essential for the optimal performance of filtering algorithms. If the noise process is not white, it may exhibit correlations or non-stationarities that can degrade the filtering performance. To account for such limitations, experimental design can be modified by incorporating techniques such as noise modeling, robust filtering, or adaptive filtering. For instance, noise modeling can involve characterizing the noise process using more sophisticated models, such as colored noise or non-Gaussian noise models, to better capture its statistical properties. Robust filtering techniques, on the other hand, can be designed to be more resilient to deviations from the white noise assumption, by using methods such as robust Kalman filtering or H-infinity filtering. Additionally, adaptive filtering techniques can be employed to dynamically adjust the filtering parameters in response to changes in the noise process, thereby improving the overall filtering performance.

To mitigate these errors and improve retrieval accuracy, several approaches can be employed. Firstly, using data augmentation with ASR noise to train a dense retriever has been shown to be a promising approach for increasing robustness against ASR noise. Additionally, typo-robust dense retrieval approaches can also increase robustness against ASR noise to some extent, although they are not as effective as ASR data augmentation.

Finally, to study a real-world scenario with voice variation and non-native speakers voicing questions, we also build a new test set where the questions have natural ASR noise. This set consists of 700 questions voiced by human annotators.We aim to answer the following research questions: RQ1 What is the impact on the performance of lexical and dense retrievers when questions have ASR errors? RQ2 Are typo-robust dense retrieval approaches also robust against ASR noise? How competitive are they against dense retrieval trained via data augmentation with ASR noise? RQ3 Do certain accents affect the effectiveness of the retriever more than others?

        " in this direction.Since there is no available dataset for passage retrieval where questions have ASR noise, we simulate ASR noise by automatically transcribing synthetically voiced questions. We then compare the robustness of lexical and dense retrievers by evaluating them against questions with and without ASR noise. Preliminary results showed that neither lexical nor dense models are effective against questions with ASR noise leading to a significant drop in retrieval performance. We find that using data augmentation with ASR noise to train a dense retriever is a promising approach for increasing robustness against ASR noise. However, the generation of such synthetic data is time-consuming and limited to the languages/accents supported by the text-to-speech system. To this extent, we explore if typo augmentation (faster and not bound to specific accents/languages) can alleviate these limitations. Our experimental results show that typo robust dense retrievers can increase robustness against ASR noise to some extent; however, ASR data augmentation remains a significantly more effective approach. Since users can have different local accents, we experiment with multiple accents of the same language and unveil that users' accents play an important role in retrieval performance.

Even though they can increase robustness compared to standard training on clean questions only, dense retrieval trained via data augmentation with ASR noise is a more effective approach.

Aligning with previous methodologies, we maintain consistency by averaging the BLEU scores to derive a comprehensive assessment of the generated summaries in comparison to the reference texts.BLEU. The BLEU score is a metric originally proposed for evaluating the quality of translations at the document level. This metric relies on precision and evaluates the geometric precision of n-grams between the generated text and the ground truth text. For a translation T, a reference R and a range from 1 to N of n-grams, the BLEU score is calculated as follows:\\begin{aligned}BLEU(N, T, R) = (\\prod _{n",

The BLEU score, designed to evaluate text similarity between generated and reference text, possesses limitations when applied to assess code generation tasks due to its emphasis on linguistic resemblance rather than functional equivalence. Consequently, accurately functional yet linguistically dissimilar code may receive suboptimal BLEU scores, rendering it an inadequate metric for code evaluation. For code generation, we employ CodeBLEU and EM@k. CodeBLEU is proposed to validate the syntactic and semantic data flow accuracy inherent in code generation models. CodeBLEU stands as a composite measure which injects code syntax via abstract syntax trees (AST) and code semantics via data flow.

However, it requires a physical law, and the inference assumes that the physical phenomenon is strictly modeled by that law.

Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that TPLLM exhibits commendable performance in both full-sample and few-shot prediction scenarios, effectively supporting the development of ITS in regions with scarce historical traffic data.\nIntroduction: To mitigate the mounting strain of traffic congestion and curb the economic losses and environmental pollution it spawns, numerous countries have embarked on fostering the development and implementation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Traffic prediction is a core functionality of ITS , and the attainment of precise predictive outcomes is critically important for both traffic status analysis and effective traffic management. For example, accurate traffic flow prediction empowers traffic management authorities to issue timely congestion alerts, thereby enabling drivers to circumvent congested routes, which directly contributes to a reduction in average vehicle travel time and, consequently, a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions .With the technological advances in recent years, emerging technologies spearheaded by deep learning have furnished increasingly efficient and",

An embedding module is designed based on convolutional neural networks and graph convolutional networks. This module aims to enable LLMs to understand time-series data and to fuse spatiotemporal features implied within the traffic data. To reduce training costs and maintain high fine-tuning quality, we applied a cost-effective fine-tuning method, LoRA, to TPLLM. This approach preserves TPLLM's existing knowledge, also improving its efficiency in making accurate traffic predictions with limited data. We conducted experiments in scenarios with sufficient and limited training data, respectively, to make the proposed method highly relevant to the realistic situations. The results validate that the prior knowledge in pretrained LLMs can be effectively applied to traffic prediction.The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of related studies. Section 3 explains the traffic prediction issue and the structure",
        " analyzing traffic data and deciphering complex spatiotemporal patterns.In order to introduce pretrained LLMs to the traffic prediction task and overcome the few-shot challenge caused by data cost, we propose TPLLM, a framework for traffic prediction based on pretrained LLMs. The central idea of the TPLLM is to shape the multivariate time-series traffic data into a form that is understandable by LLMs in a token embedding-like manner, thus exploiting the prior knowledge in the LLMs. To further enhance the model's understanding of the spatial features of the traffic data, we also append graph-structured spatial information of the road network to the input. The final output from the LLMs is used in order to generate traffic prediction results. To optimize training efficiency and fine-tuning effectiveness, we employ a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach, specifically Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) , significantly reducing training costs without compromising performance. Our experiments show that with the powerful prior knowledge and inference capabilities of LLMs, the TPLLM can efficiently complete the regular traffic prediction task and perform equally well on the few-shot prediction task. {{figure:f3f1e757-85c9-433"

B.107.245423 (2023)] in Majorana nanowires, we theoretically investigate local and nonlocal transport in Majorana nanowires in various disorder regimes, correlating the transport properties with the corresponding local and total density of states as well as various topological diagnostics. We find three distinct disorder regimes, with weak (strong) disorder regimes manifesting (not manifesting) topological superconductivity with clear end Majorana zero modes for longer (but not necessarily for shorter) wires. The intermediate disorder regime is both interesting and challenging because the topology depends on many details in addition to the strength of disorder, such as the precise disorder configuration and the wire length. The intermediate disorder regime often manifests multiple effective transitions between topological and nontopological phases as a function of system parameters (e.g., the Zeeman field), and is consistent with the recent Microsoft experiment reflecting small topological gaps and narrow topological regimes in the parameter space.\nIntroduction: A recent Microsoft experiment represents a breakthrough in",

By comparing these eight different properties in the weak, intermediate, and strong disorder regimes, we conclude that the recent breakthrough Microsoft experiment is in the intermediate disorder regime where the effective disorder strength is larger than the induced superconducting gap, but perhaps not so large as to completely suppress the topological properties as in the strong disorder regime. The weak disorder regime, characterized by a disorder strength comparable to or less than the induced gap, manifests topology essentially identical to the pristine case, reflecting the robustness of topology to local perturbations. The intermediate disorder case is complex, with many competing factors complicating a simple interpretation of the conductance data. There may be multiple transitions between topological and nontopological phases with increasing Zeeman splitting because of the presence of disorder-induced multiple Majorana modes throughout the bulk.

In particular, we calculate the total and local density of states as well as several theoretical diagnostics for topology and Majorana zero modes such as the transport topological invariant , , , , the thermal conductance , , and the Majorana localization length (which is effectively the SC coherence length) . We emphasize that experimentally only the tunnel conductance matrix is measured directly, and our calculations of the other theoretical quantities enable a deeper understanding of the underlying topology as compared with the conductance. A comparison among all these results, presented in Sec. of this paper, gives a nuanced view of the complicated interplay among disorder, topology, finite wire length, and superconductivity, showing that finite nanowires in the intermediate disorder regime (which is likely to be the regime of current experimental interest) is a rather complicated system to understand using minimal physical pictures. It appears that longer wires and less disorder are essential in obtaining a clear decisive interpretation of the experimental results, although we do find that the intermediate-disorder regime allows the existence of fragile topological regimes with small gaps existing over small regimes of experimental parameters as claimed in Ref. .

The metallicity gradients, typically 0.5 dex/R_e, and the higher metallicities of younger sub-populations, imply a complex formation mechanism. The similarities between dEs and massive elliptical galaxies, such as NGC205, suggest that internal processes, like gas stripping, may have triggered the quenching of star formation, while environmental factors played a role in shaping their evolution.

Obviously, for the galaxies of the present sample that have constant or slowly decaying SFR (half of the sample), the returned gas from the old stellar population is not a significant contribution and we can exclude that these galaxies were stripped of their gas at an old epoch.As for the Local Group galaxies, the most stricking aspect is the detection of an old population ({{formula:ea07602b-e022-450d-9668-1d4f4803caf9}} 10 Gyr) in almost all the galaxies of the sample.

The old population amounting for a dominant fraction of the mass is compatible with being co-eval of the oldest populations of massive elliptical galaxies, or bulges.

The development of more accurate theoretical models of stellar evolution in these systems should take into account these correlations and the implications for the formation and evolution of the Halo.

Total abundance errors are estimated to about 0.1-0.2 dex for most elements, while relative abundances are most probably more accurate. We have made an extensive comparison with other similar studies and traced the reasons for the, in most cases, relatively small differences. Among the results we note the following: We find [O/Fe] from the O I IR- triplet lines to possibly increase beyond [Fe/H]=-1.0, though considerably less than obtained by others from abundances based on OH lines. We find correlations among the deviations for individual stars from the trends of individual alpha elements relative to Fe. This may support the idea that the formation of the Halo stars occurred in smaller systems with different star formation rates. We verify the finding by Gratton et al. (2003b",

In Fig. REF we thus plot the abundances of O, Mg, Si and Ti relative to Fe directly vs. [Ca/Fe] for our stars (circles), as well as for the disk stars in Edvardsson et al.

Variations in this parameter significantly impact the resulting magnetic field strengths and patterns in experimental and theoretical models. According to Kutzner and Christensen's study, the Rayleigh number is a controlling parameter that needs to be varied to investigate dynamo properties. Their 'phase diagram' for dynamo action reveals two regimes: one at low forcing, characterized by strongly dipolar but non-reversing dynamos, and another corresponding to reversing but multipolar dynamos. However, the models presented in these diagrams suffer from parameters remote from geophysically relevant estimates, making direct comparison with the actual geodynamo challenging. The threshold value for dipolar dynamos decreases with the Ekman number, and a scaling in the form of Ra_c ∝ E^(-3/4) has been proposed, with a numerical fit to Ra_c = 450E^(-3/4). This suggests that the Rayleigh number has a significant impact on the magnetic field patterns, with lower values leading to dipolar dynamos and higher values resulting in multipolar dynamos.",

Its value is difficult to assess in a simple Boussinesq model. This will be the most obvious controlling parameter, which needs to be varied to investigate dynamo properties.Kutzner and Christensen [KC02] performed a first systematic exploration of the parameter space available to numerical models of the geodynamo. They produced a “phase diagram” for dynamo action in terms of Ekman number {{formula:007b368a-87db-42f5-903d-86c330af6417}} and magnetic Prandtl number (or equivalently here Roberts number, {{formula:1ead2090-fd5f-47ff-8f72-f0226a0ddaa3}} ) and Rayleigh number {{formula:367ae501-5b9d-402a-a720-f28518b564aa}} .

One at low forcing, characterised by strongly dipolar, but non-reversing dynamos, and another corresponding to reversing, but multipolar dynamos. This, of course, is not a very good news when comparing these models with the geodynamo (characterized by a reversing strongly dipolar field).As pointed above, all models presented in these diagrams suffer from parameters extremely remote from their geophysically relevant estimates. In particular, the Ekman number {{formula:dbc8d0e5-d020-4e7d-ac6c-1282c94dede8}} is over-estimated by a factor in excess of a billion and the magnetic Prandtl number {{formula:35c3f5ed-10a4-4c10-b154-a7b18e88529c}} by a factor close to a million.

The authors noted that the threshold value {{formula:c0c90fe3-3848-4fcd-ba9a-866db07d4ee0}} , below which dipolar dynamos are lost decreases with the Ekman number.

However, in scenarios where the database is held by a third party, such as a cloud server, both parties are concerned about data privacy. To address this concern, we propose CryptoMask, a privacy-preserving face recognition system that employs homomorphic encryption (HE) and secure multi-party computation (MPC). We design a new encoding strategy that leverages HE properties to reduce communication costs and enable efficient similarity checks between face images, without expensive homomorphic rotation. Additionally, CryptoMask leaks less information than existing state-of-the-art approaches. CryptoMask only reveals whether there is an image matching the query or not, whereas existing approaches additionally leak sensitive intermediate distance information. We conduct extensive experiments that demonstrate CryptoMask's superior performance in terms of computation and communication.

The Eddington-Finkelstein gauge simplifies the computation of the energy-momentum tensor by allowing for a diagonal gauge, which reduces the number of independent components. This, in turn, affects our understanding of spacetime geometry, as it provides a more intuitive and straightforward way of visualizing the curvature of spacetime. Furthermore, the Eddington-Finkelstein gauge is invariant under gauge transformations generated by the gauge field strength, which provides a deeper understanding of the underlying symmetries of the theory.

Internal reference coverage refers to the proportion of references from a database that are also included in the same database, which can vary across disciplines and databases. For instance, the coverage rate was found to be highest in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, at around 90%, and vastly lower in the Arts and Humanities. To optimize their citation analysis and minimize potential biases, researchers can compare the internal reference coverage of different databases, such as OpenAlex, WoS, and Scopus, and consider the size and disciplinary profile of each database, as well as the accuracy of its reference matching procedure. Additionally, researchers can use open metadata, such as open abstracts and ORCIDs, to improve the accuracy and completeness of their citation analysis.

These considerations show why internal reference coverage provides merely a partial and possibly source-biased measurement of coverage.Nevertheless, when comparing citation index databases, the differences in internal reference collection can be a useful guide when choosing the most suitable data source for a planned bibliometric study. There are no established guidelines for numerical values of coverage proportions required to allow reliable studies to be carried out. But, for example, analysed the combined ISI Citation Indexes (the predecessor of today's Web of Science) and found that the coverage rate, which is the proportion of references from the 2002 source year that refer to ISI source journals, was highest for Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, at around 90%, followed by human-focused Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Clinical Medicine and Physics and Astronomy. It was vastly lower in the Arts and Humanities and intermediary in the Social Sciences, Mathematics and Engineering.When using this indicator to compare OpenAlex, WoS and Scopus, we are less interested in an evaluation in absolute values, but rather in assessing how OpenAlex performs in comparison to the two established bibliometric databases.",
        " an evaluation in absolute values, but rather in assessing how OpenAlex performs in comparison to the two established bibliometric databases. Internal reference coverage depends on the size and possibly the disciplinary profile of a database as well as the accuracy of its reference matching procedure. As OpenAlex is actually much larger than Scopus and WoS (see Table REF ) it could be expected that its internal reference coverage is at least not lower than in the latter databases.\nOpen Metadata: The increasing discussion surrounding the open availability of various types of scholarly metadata in bibliometrics is not limited to reference coverage, but expands to other metadata . For instance, the Initiative for Open Abstracts (I4OAhttps://i4oa.org/) advocates open abstracts of scholarly works and calls on scholarly publishers to submit them to Crossref, a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) registration agency. However, coverage analyses of Crossref suggest that not all publishers provide open scholarly metadata to Crossref , . Another example of essential metadata is the use of ORCIDs to persistently identify authors, helping bibliometricians not only to disambiguate author names, but also to interlink different data from different sources based on the ORCID . As open data sources are essential for OpenAlex,",
        "We are aware that these initial assessments are likely to change with further developments, so this report should be understood as reflecting the state as of late 2023.\nReference Coverage: References are of central importance for bibliometric databases, as matching them to their target items forms the basis for the calculation of citation metrics. As a first step, we compare average reference counts between the three databases, whereby the basis of the comparison are the complete databases, then subsets of publications with the document type `article', and a shared sub-corpus of publications covered by all three databases. Furthermore, references can also be used for an assessment of the coverage, i.e. the proportion of relevant research publications that are included in the database and accessible to users for analysis . An insufficient or biased coverage of the relevant literature should rule out the use of a database for a particular study.There are different ways to determine the coverage of a database, for example, the comparison with external lists of relevant sources or publication lists of a sample of representative researchers of the studied fields. One relatively simple way to study literature coverage is calculating the internal reference coverage of a database as a whole or in relation to grouping characteristics, such as disciplines, the literature of particular countries or language communities.The internal coverage"

Optimization of these techniques for future experiments can be achieved by improving the efficiency of muon identification, enhancing the precision of jet reconstruction, and developing more sophisticated algorithms for discriminating between signal and background events.

Therefore, the task of the regressor block is to locate a potential diver in the image-space, whereas the classifier block provides the confidence scores associated with that detection.The proposed model has a sparse convolutional block and uses a three layer regressor block instead of using an RPN. As demonstrated in Table REF , it has significantly fewer network parameters compared to the state-of-the-art object detection models."

      "expected_output": "The relationship between connectivity patterns and consensus time in distributed systems is complex, with the time needed to reach complete consensus diverging as the system size grows, depending on the connectivity pattern. Understanding this relationship can inform the design of more efficient consensus protocols by considering the recurrence properties of random walks on the network. For instance, on regular lattices, the voter model orders exponentially fast due to the recurrence of random walks, whereas on networks with transient random walks, the voter model does not order. The design of consensus protocols should take into account the topology of the network, as randomness in connectivity patterns can lead to metastable states and indefinitely cycling through configurations with the same energy. By considering these factors, more efficient consensus protocols can be designed to mitigate the effects of metastable states and promote coherent ordering processes.",

When {{formula:ba5ad3e0-af77-41f4-86d7-22813f2955c3}} grows the time needed to reach complete consensus diverges, in a way that depends on the connectivity pattern. If one considers the number of active bonds {{formula:95846b62-b962-49c6-9230-46c8e74dcd0c}} as a function of time averaged over all realizations of the dynamics, including those that already have reached the fully ordered state, one sees an exponential decay. This may lead to the conclusion that the the system actually orders exponentially fast (i.e. faster than on regular lattices). However, this conclusion disagrees with the connection between the voter dynamics and the recurrence properties of random walks. The recurrence of the random walk on regular lattices for {{formula:e1847bb2-9149-477a-adb6-2549b27b80d1}} implies that the voter model orders on them, while it remains in a disordered state when the walk is transient ({{formula:54f6b188-28a6-4483",

The same argument implies that the voter model does not order on networks, as those considered here, for which the random walk is transient . The solution of this apparent paradox is that the voter model actually does not get ordered on networks in the thermodynamical limit. The right quantity to observe this is the density of active bonds in surviving runs {{formula:a436a2f9-7758-481c-8368-ba3afeefc355}} , which does not decay to zero; it attains large values, signaling that in surviving runs the system is again split in two domains with a large number of interconnections. Notice that this is true also for the complete graph.For Glauber dynamics on a complete graph full ordering is attained for any system size, including the thermodynamic limit. Randomness in the connectivity pattern implies instead that even a finite system has a nonzero probability to remain trapped in metastable states, i.e. to indefinitely cycle through configurations with the same energy. In such metastable configurations, the system is split in two",

Making perturbative calculations in this problem meets certain difficulties reminiscent of those in the problem of pointlike anyons. We show how to circumvent these difficulties for anyons of arbitrary spin. The case of spin 1/2 is special because it allows for a direct application of perturbation theory, while for any other spin, a redefinition of the wave function is necessary. We apply the perturbative algorithm to the N-body problem, derive the first-order equation of state and discuss some examples.\nIntroduction: The topology of two-dimensional space allows for existence of anyons , , particles with statistics intermediate between bosonic and fermionic. However, the real world being three-dimensional, no particles with inherent anyonic statistics can exist; in reality such statistics can only arise effectively by means of an interaction.

However, control of modular, multi-limbed soft robots for terrestrial locomotion is challenging due to the complex robot structure, actuator mechanics and robot-environment interaction. Traditionally, soft robot control is performed by modeling kinematics using exact geometric equations and finite element analysis. The research presents an alternative, model-free, data-driven, reinforcement learning inspired approach, for controlling multi-limbed soft material robots. This control approach can be summarized as a four-step process of discretization, visualization, learning and optimization. The first step involves identification and subsequent discretization of key factors that dominate robot-environment, in turn, the robot control. Graph theory is used to visualize relationships and transitions between the discretized states.

        "-based approaches such as and achieve the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on several event-based datasets, while enjoying higher efficiency than point-cloud-based methods, due to the good regularity for parallel computing on GPUs.Nonetheless, the voxel-based methods have to compress the data drastically to meet the memory and computational requirements, and hence suffer from information loss. According to the observation in our early-stage experiments, the reduced temporal resolution also causes problems such as motion blur and accuracy drop for dynamic scenes. Moreover, to fit the neural networks originally designed for image data, they usually stack the different frames along the channel axis , , which makes the temporal information tangle with channel information. Therefore, voxel-based methods are limited by information loss and flexibility under scenes at different speeds.To this end, we propose an efficient representation for event data, which can alleviate the information loss problem of voxel-based methods, while also being robust under both static and dynamic scenes. We name it Aligned Event Tensor (AET). In AET, the event data are quantized and voxelized in high temporal resolution to minimize information loss. The voxels are then compressed in local spatial-temporal regions",
        " approaches encounter motion blur problems due to the drastic compression in the compromise of memory cost (e.g., 30k times compression to 9 frames). The accuracy also drops because of information loss during the compression from spatial-temporal 3D to 2D. In addition, we argue that since events are triggered by the moving objects in the real world, the pixel-wise operation in , will mistakenly compress events from different objects (or parts) into one element, causing the misalignment problem.\nMethodology: In this section, we will introduce the proposed Aligned Event Tensor (AET) and the Event Frame Net (EFN).

However, the event data are noisy, sparse, and nonuniform in the spatial-temporal domain with an extremely high temporal resolution, making it challenging to design backend algorithms for event-based vision. Existing methods encode events into point-cloud-based or voxel-based representations, but suffer from noise and/or information loss. Additionally, there is little research that systematically studies how to handle static and dynamic scenes with one universal design for event-based vision. This work proposes the Aligned Event Tensor (AET) as a novel event data representation, and a neat framework called Event Frame Net (EFN), which enables our model for event-based vision under static and dynamic scenes. The proposed AET and EFN are evaluated on various datasets, and proved to surpass existing state-of-the-art methods by large margins. Our method is also efficient and achieves the fastest inference speed among others.\nIntroduction: Recently,"

      "expected_output": "The implications of user-specific effects on the integration of Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) systems are significant, as they can improve the correct classification of alive fingerprints of genuine users, which is crucial in fingerprint verification systems. Experimental design can account for these variations by incorporating user-specific information, such as skin characteristics and fingerprint features, into the PAD system. This can be achieved by using the data acquired during the recognition system's initial enrollment phase to lower the PAD error rate and improve the integrated system's performance. The user-specific approach can be exploited in real applications, where the enrollment phase allows recording the user's fingerprint image previously, to optimize theoretical contributions and practical applications. Furthermore, the experimental methodology should consider the correlation between textural features coming from the same fingerprints of the same user and even from their different fingerprints, as reported in previous studies. By acknowledging and leveraging the user-specific effect, PAD systems can be designed to minimize the rejection rate of genuine users, ultimately enhancing the overall performance and security of fingerprint verification systems.",

        " a PAD must be integrated into a fingerprint verification system, the templates of genuine users are available, and there is no good reason to neglect them even during the PAD design. We referred to the additional information coming from the enrolled user as “user-specific effect” .These aspects have been analyzed only marginally in the LivDet 2017 report for sake of space. Moreover, the above points were not addressed by the previous editions of LivDet, whose history and results over the years are reported in .With regard to the “user-specific effect”, we reported in that some specific components or minute details are dependent on the user's skin characteristic. Ref. reports a statistical study on the relationships of textural features coming from the same fingerprints of the same user and even from his/her different fingerprints. The correlation we measured suggests that the consequent “bias” introduced into a PAD can be beneficial if the PAD must be integrated into a fingerprint verification system. Moreover, it does not affect the overall PAD performance when it is used for the generic user of detecting a presentation attack.

        " In fact, the existence of artifacts due to the human skin (person-specific) and to the particular curvature of ridges and valleys (finger-specific) can impact in PAD systems' performance , and can be exploit to improve the integrated system. In particular, the data acquired during the recognition system's initial enrollment phase can be used to lower the PAD error rate and consequently, to improve the integrated system performance. This approach may be referred to as “user-specific\", whilst the other one may be referred to as “generic user\". It is important to emphasize that stand-alone PAD systems are usually considered based on “generic user\" approaches. Usually, a generic user approach is claimed to avoid biased results. This was evident in some early works , where an unexpected and unexplained drop of error rates occurred when some users were present both in the train and in the test set, because the user-specific effect was not yet clear in the mind of the scholars.However, this biasing may be desired under certain circumstances. In fact, as already mentioned, the positive influence of the user-specific effect on the live/fake classification can be exploited in real applications, where the enrolment phase allows to record the user fingerprint image previously.

Extensive experiments on three age databases are conducted to comprehensively evaluate the proposed method.

Although numerous studies have been conducted in this topic, there are two major problems: 1) multiple models are usually trained to simulate different age mappings, and 2) the photo-realism of generated face images is heavily influenced by the variation of training images in terms of pose, illumination, and background. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a framework based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) to achieve age progression and regression simultaneously. Particularly, since face aging and rejuvenation are largely different in terms of image translation patterns, we model these two processes using two separate generators, each dedicated to one age changing process. In addition, we exploit spatial attention mechanisms to limit image modifications to regions closely related to age changes, so that images with high visual fidelity could be synthesized for in-the-wild cases.

Experimental verification is challenging due to the extremal nature of these black holes, but theoretical models and simulations can provide insights into the behavior of extremal black holes and their implications for our understanding of black hole thermodynamics. The vanishing entropy of extremal black holes is consistent with Planck's version of the third law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of a system tends to a constant value, potentially zero, as the temperature approaches zero.

That is gravitational charge contained inside the horizon vanishes for an extremal black hole. If entropy of the hole is to depend upon gravitational charge contained in the hole, it should also vanish for an extremal hole as argued in , . There is however no relation connecting entropy with gravitational charge. All we can say is that area of the horizon is not a measure of entropy of extremal hole.Here an analogy can be drawn between extremal and non-extremal black holes, and photons and ordinary particles, indicating their characteristic difference. The analogy suggests that gravitational charge {{formula:e5c21b92-ed86-4bdc-8152-6d45d6ae9041}} corresponds to rest mass, we have {{formula:2d515520-555a-46ad-8582-e55f0f2cfa8f}} analogus {{formula:",

The identification of area with entropy is true only for the latter and is not true for the former. For the extremal case entropy can be deduced separately and it vanishes, thus according well with Planck's version. The conclusion is that area of the event horizon does not always measure entropy of the hole. It does so only for non-extremal black holes while for extremal case area is though finite and non-zero but entropy turns out to be zero. This is a new proposal based primarily on non-classical considerations.Let us look at the familiar mass formula for a black hole, {{formula:5c8326f6-03b5-4576-873d-d3737087e1af}}where all symbols have the usual meaning. In thermodynamical sense the first term on the right should measure the internal energy (enthalpy) while the remaining two terms indicate the work done",
        " shall argue that the law can also be stated by replacing surface gravity by gravitational charge enclosed by the horizon. Gravitational charge of a hole can be defined by the flux of red-shifted proper acceleration across the closed 2-surface defined by the horizon , and value of the acceleration at the horizon defines the surface gravity. Thus the two quantities are intimately related. By considering variation in gravitational charge and applying the area non-decrease theorem, we would like to exhibit how it cannot be reduced to zero in finite sequence of physical processes. It turns out that as extremality ({{formula:593b26ec-43a3-4fee-b31e-9ea4c14ce77a}} ) is approached, the window for allowed range of parameters of infalling energy and radiation pinches off.The third law of thermodynamics has two essentially equivalent statements; (a) isothermal reversible processes turn isentropic as temperature of a system approaches zero, and (b) temperature cannot be reduced to zero in finite number of physical operations . There is yet another stronger version due to Planck which states that the entropy of any system tends to an absolute constant, which can be taken as zero, as temperature tends to zero.In the case of"

Dual-decomposition was used by Wainwright et al. to derive algorithms for inference in graphical models and has become increasingly popular in the computer vision literature recently due to its flexibility .We consider bounding the planar correlation clustering by a decomposition into two sub-problems, an easier partitioning problem and an independent edge problem that does not enforce the clustering constraints. To make the partitioning problem tractable, we impose a constraint on the decomposition so that the cost of the optimal clustering can be computed.

The collection of cuts form constraints in a linear program that lower-bounds the energy of the true correlation clustering.

The push-relabel (preflow-push) algorithm , in particular, represents a cornerstone in solving the maximum flow problem due to its efficiency and versatility. This algorithm iteratively improves the flow within a network by locally pushing excess flow at vertices until the algorithm achieves an optimal flow, leveraging relabel operations to dynamically adjust the heights of nodes to maintain a valid flow.As graphs grow to encompass billions of nodes and edges, traditional CPU-based solutions need help with the computational requirements necessary to process such immense datasets efficiently. This limitation is particularly pronounced in the applications handling large-scale social networks, web graphs, and biological networks, where the ability to compute efficiently maximum flow or minimum cut is fundamental but essential for analyzing or understanding",

Goldberg et al. proposed the push-relabel algorithm (also known as the preflow-push algorithm), which focuses on local operations to adjust the flows. Some optimizations are based on it to improve the complexity to O(V^2E).\nGeneric Parallel Push-relabel Algorithm: The basic idea of the push-relabel algorithm is to generate as much flow as possible at the source, and gradually push it to the sink. It introduces the excess flow concept that allows a vertex to have multiple flows coming into it; namely, it allows a vertex to have more flow coming in than passing out during the push-relabel procedure, this vertex is called active. We denote e(v) as the excess flow value on vertex v. The procedure of the push-relabel algorithm is to find active vertices and apply push and relabel operations on them until there are no remaining active vertices. To find the initial active vertices,",

Because the finding minimum operation has a very low arithmetic intensity, the peak bandwidth grain can benefit our implementation the most. After finding the minimum-height neighbor, we will use the delegated thread in a warp, whose localIdx is 0, to execute the push or relabel operations.\nExperiment Setup: Applications and datasets.

      "expected_output": "The maximal diameter theorem has significant implications for the geometric properties of metric measure spaces, as it provides a bound on the diameter of such spaces under certain conditions. This theorem, as discussed in the context of the research papers by Ketterer, Kitabeppu, and Lakzian, and Petrunin, contributes to our understanding of the curvature and metric structure of these spaces. Theoretical contributions of this theorem can be applied to experimental design in geometric analysis by informing the construction of spaces with specific geometric properties, such as non-negative curvature in the sense of Alexandrov spaces. Furthermore, the characterization of low-dimensional spaces and the study of the curvature tensor of smoothable Alexandrov spaces can guide the development of new methodologies for analyzing and comparing geometric structures. The implications of these findings can be explored in various applications, including the study of geometric and metric inequalities, the analysis of limit spaces, and the investigation of geometric properties under GH convergence. By integrating these theoretical advancements into experimental design, researchers can develop more sophisticated tools for analyzing and understanding complex geometric phenomena.",

      "expected_output": "Theoretical implications of using dimensional regularization versus cutoff regularization in loop integrals involve the treatment of divergences and the preservation of symmetries. Dimensional regularization is a method that retains gauge invariance and is widely used in high-energy physics, whereas cutoff regularization, such as sharp cutoff or proper time formalism, may violate gauge invariance but can be useful for certain calculations. Practically, dimensional regularization allows for the absorption of divergences into renormalized parameters, making it a preferred choice for many loop integral calculations. In contrast, cutoff regularization requires the introduction of an infrared cutoff, which can be set to zero or a small value, and may lead to additional complications. The choice between these methods can impact the accuracy and reliability of results in high-energy physics experiments, particularly in the context of quantum field theory and particle physics. For instance, in the given context, relating divergent loop integrals to physical parameters, such as the gluon transition, can help avoid detailed calculations of loop integrals, and the relevant form factors found in literature can provide a range of values for the coupling constants. Ultimately, the selection of regularization method depends on the specific problem, the desired level of precision, and the theoretical framework being employed.",

The reason is that the BN parameters are not trained well at 10 epoch during the supernet training if all parameters are trained, as show in Fig. REF (a). Training all parameters leads to inconsistent convolution parameters at different training epochs, hindering the BN parameters from converging faster. Inspired by this insight, we try to reduce the required training epoch of supernet by only training the BN parameters.

Overshooting from the Schwarzschild boundary of the convective cores during the central H-burning phase can lead to changes in the stellar mass range, metallicity, and initial He mass fraction.

The database provides two large grids, with and without the inclusion of convective core overshooting, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of its effects on stellar structure and composition.

Scaled solar models and isochrones\nabstract: We present a large and updated stellar evolution database for low-, intermediate- and high-mass stars in a wide metallicity range, suitable for studying Galactic and extragalactic simple and composite stellar populations using population synthesis techniques. The stellar mass range is between \\sim0.5Mo and 10Mo with a fine mass spacing. The metallicity [Fe/H] comprises 10 values ranging from -2.27 to 0.40, with a scaled solar metal distribution. The initial He mass fraction ranges from Y=0.245, for the more metal-poor composition, up to 0.303 for the more metal-rich one, with Delta Y/Delta Z\\sim 1.4. For each adopted chemical composition, the evolutionary models have been computed without and with overshooting from the Schwarzschild boundary of the convective cores during the central H-burning phase. The whole set of evolutionary models can be used to compute isochrones in a wide age range, from \\sim30 Myr to \\sim15Gyr. Both evolutionary tracks and is",

This notwithstanding, we have never published an extended and homogeneous set of stellar models covering a large range of stellar masses, chemical compositions and evolutionary phases, suitable for population synthesis analysis as well as for any other kind of investigation making extensive use of stellar evolution models.The main purpose of this work is to fill this gap, by providing an up-to-date and complete set of stellar models for both low-and intermediate mass, and high mass stars up to 10 {{formula:02de45dc-24d0-461f-b59b-058296e5e308}} , spanning a large metallicity regime from metal-poor star systems to super-metal-rich populations.

In the context of gravitational physics research, the Killing vectors are used to derive the constants of motion, which are essential for understanding the behavior of particles and fields in curved spacetime. The experimental design of gravitational physics research often relies on the identification of Killing vectors to determine the symmetries of the spacetime and to develop predictive models of gravitational phenomena. For instance, the Killing vectors associated with the covectors ξμ and ημ are used to derive the constants of motion, which are given by the equations ∂ξμ/∂λ = 0 and ∂ημ/∂λ = 0, where λ is an affine parameter. The conservation of these constants is crucial for understanding the behavior of particles and fields in curved spacetime, and the Killing vectors play a central role in this process. Furthermore, the planar anchoring of molecules at the boundaries and the optical path difference are used to determine the metric tensor, which is essential for understanding the spacetime geometry and the behavior of particles and fields.

In this respect the Born-Infeld theory is unique (except for another singular and unphysical Lagrangian {{formula:2f369754-786c-40da-a2a1-fe8ab03606a0}} ).

Instead, the data positioning derives from the observed phenomenon and it is part of the data. Therefore, projection and reproduction are characterized by considerably different methodologies that confer them distinct classifications, namely, explicit projection and implicit projection (rendering). Pre-attentive Stimuli In this section we analyze well-known visualization techniques in order to empirically identify how attributes Position, Shape and Color are used to express information. Position Position is the primary component for pre-attention perception in visualization scenes and it is strictly related to the spatialization process. So, while spatialization is the cornerstone for enabling visual data analysis (as it maps data to the visual/spatial domain), it also dictates the mechanism for pre-attentive positional perception. Thus, positional pre-attention occurs in the form of Arrangement, Correspondence and Referential, explained in the following paragraphs. These classes derive, respectively, from spatializations Structure Exposition, Patterned and Projection/Reproduction. Structure Exposition {{formula:fd82fb64-6fda",

Reproduction {{formula:0522b8ad-9f32-47dd-8b38-6f12d9bd3c7b}} Referential: the position of an element, discrete or continuous, is given relative to an explicit reference, such as a geographical map (Figure REF (b)), a meaningful shape (Figure REF (a)) or a set of axes (Figure REF (b)); {{figure:f6cbbe2d-82ff-4468-a33f-912002d57e01}}We observe that spatialization based on Reproduction can yield all the three kinds of positional pre-attention: arrangement, correspondence or referential.

Shape We argued so far that a limited number of spatialization procedures is at the core of visualization techniques, and that these spatialization procedures dictate the positional pre-attentive stimulus. Nevertheless, after spatializing the data one still needs to choose their shape and color, other pre-attentive stimuli. In this and the following sections we investigate how shape and color contribute to visual perception. In particular, the Shape stimulus embraces the largest number of possibilities to express information: Differentiation, Correspondence, Meaning and/or Relationship. Differentiation: the shape displayed discriminates the items for further interpretation, as in Figures REF (a), REF (a) and REF (a); Correspondence: discrete (Figure REF (a)) or continuous (Figure REF (b)), each noticeable shape corresponds to one informative feature. Proportion (variable sizing) is the most used variation for this practice; Meaning: the shape displayed carries meaning, such as an arrow, a face or a complex shape (e.g. text), whose comprehension may depend on user's knowledge and previous experience, as depicted in Figures REF (b) and REF ("

To address these limitations, a higher dimensional filter can be employed to remove sensitivity to band slope. Additionally, experimental design and theoretical contributions can focus on developing filters that adapt to the varying slopes of the bands, such as using a 2D filter that can remove background features and reduce artifacts. The use of a negative second derivative in Fourier space, equivalent to weighting Fourier components by a factor of -k^2, can also help to sharpen data and improve signal-to-background ratio.

MCMCP is a method that combines ideas from cognitive science and machine learning to estimate the structure of human categories. It works by perturbing images in a deep feature space that captures essential variation, rather than adding noise to pixel intensities. The process involves repeating a chain of human trials until it converges to the target category distribution. While MCMCP has been successfully employed to capture various mental categories, its limitations include the need for a large number of human trials, which can be practically obtained, and the assumption that the category distributions have a specific structure. To address these limitations, future research can focus on developing more efficient methods for converging to the target category distribution, such as using active learning or transfer learning techniques. Additionally, incorporating more advanced deep learning models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) or variational autoencoders (VAEs), can help improve the accuracy and robustness of the estimated category structures.

Decades of research have yielded a variety of formal theories of categories, but validating them with naturalistic stimuli is difficult. The challenge is that human category representations cannot be directly observed and running informative experiments with naturalistic stimuli such as images requires a workable representation of these stimuli. Deep neural networks have recently been successful in solving a range of computer vision tasks and provide a way to compactly represent image features. Here, we introduce a method to estimate the structure of human categories that combines ideas from cognitive science and machine learning, blending human-based algorithms with state-of-the-art deep image generators. We provide qualitative and quantitative results as a proof-of-concept for the method's feasibility. Samples drawn from human distributions rival those from state-of-the-art generative models in quality and outperform alternative methods for estimating the structure of human categories.\nIntroduction: Categorization is a central problem in cognitive science and concerns why and how we divide the world into discrete units at various levels of abstraction.

Unlike classification images, this method makes no assumptions about the structure of the category distributions and thus can estimate means, variances, and higher order moments. Therefore, we take it as a starting point for the current method.\nMCMCP in deep feature spaces: The typical MCMCP experiment is effective so long as noise can be added to dimensions in the stimulus parameter space to create meaningful changes in content. In the case of natural images, noise in the space of all pixel intensities is very unlikely to modify the stimulus in meaningful ways. Instead, we propose perturbing images in a deep feature space that captures only essential variation. Since trials in an MCMCP experiment are not independent,"

It has recently been demonstrated that with increasing baryon density, the different quark flavors may occur sequentially, starting with down-quarks only, before the second light quark flavor and at highest densities also the strange quark flavor appears. We find that color superconducting phases are favorable over non-superconducting ones which entails consequences for thermodynamic and transport properties of hybrid star matter. In particular, for NJL-type models no strange quark matter phases can occur in compact star interiors due to mechanical instability against gravitational collapse, unless a sufficiently strong flavor mixing as provided by the Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft determinant interaction is present in the model. We discuss observational data on mass-radius relationships of compact stars which can put constraints on the properties of dense matter equation of state.\nIntroduction: The question of strangeness in compact star interiors is a multifaceted one and"

This fruitful dialogue persisted through the parallel development of these two strands of natural philosophy and was made evermore pertinent within the context of string theory, conceived to unify gravity with quantum field theory, and thereby providing an answer to Einstein’s famous dream of a Theory of Everything (ToE). Whether string theory - with its cornerstones of supersymmetry and extra space-time dimensions yet to be verified by some ingenious experiment - is truly “the” theory of Nature remains to be seen. What is indisputable is that the theory has been a Muse to pure mathematics: from enumerative geometry to Moonshine, from quantum invariants to mock modular forms, etc., the discipline has provided novel, and rather unique, methods of attack on tackling a myriad of mathematical problems.Central to string theory is the study of Calabi-Yau manifolds, serving as a beacon to such important investigations as compactification, mirror symmetry, moduli space and duality.

On the other hand, benefitting from pre-training on vast and diverse datasets, LLMs can learn intricate data features and complex semantic relationships , thus showing higher tolerance to minor input perturbations. Black-box testing methods for Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based software do not require access to the internal structure or parameters of the threat models , , . LLM-based software mostly interacts with LLMs through interfaces without access to their internal structures and parameters, essentially operating in a black-box environment. When adapting black-box testing methods designed for DNN-based software to LLM-based software testing scenarios, there is a general decline in the effectiveness of all methods. Among them, the currently best-performing baseline PWWS exhibits average test success rates of 79.395%, 54.868%, and 70.270% on the Financial Phrasebank , AG’s News , and MR datasets.

This approach is a practical choice and a key strategy to ensure that NLP software maintains efficiency and robustness in diverse application environments. It provides testers with an effective means to explore LLMs' capabilities, even without detailed model knowledge.\nTHE ABS TECHNIQUE: This section introduces the ABS technique for testing LLM-based NLP software. Our experimental findings highlight the main challenge in robustness testing for LLM-based software: the low effectiveness of transferring test methods designed for DNN-based software to LLM-based software testing scenarios (RQ1). This challenge significantly undermines the practical utility of robustness tests, necessitating our specialized design of ABS for LLM-based software. Traditional greedy search algorithms often reach local optima within the perturbation space, limiting their ability to discover significant perturbations.

Additionally, we design ABS, the first robustness testing method specifically for LLM-based NLP software, which incorporates beam search optimized for the high-dimensional feature spaces of LLMs and enhances test effectiveness and efficiency with adaptive beam width and backtracking strategy. We evaluate ABS using three datasets, five threat models, and five baselines. Experimental results show that ABS achieves an average test effectiveness of 86.138%, compared to the second-best baseline, PWWS, which scores 68.177%. ABS also requires less time and fewer queries per successful test case than PWWS. Our framework and method can be used in LLM-based NLP software research to further the academic discussion on software robustness testing among practitioners."

However, practical limitations arise from the need to determine weight matrices, which are designer-dependent, and the assumption of a linear system, which may not always hold in real-world scenarios. Experimental design can be optimized by configuring the LQR planner to plan a path for the vehicle, using a discrete form of the LQR controller, and evaluating the system's stability and performance through metrics such as the 2-norm distance of the vehicle's linear state from the desired state.

However, this conclusion leads to the embarrassing question of why there was no phase change in the experiment proposed by Peres and realized by Kaiser, George and Werner . To reconcile the theoretical predictions with the experimental observations, Davies and McKellar reiterated the Klein conclusion and suggested to subject the neutron beam to different interactions in permuted order.In the final chapter of the Adler book , we find and intriguing question.

In their paper, by translating the quaternionic Schrödinger equation into a pair of coupled complex equations and solving the corresponding complex system by numerical methods, Davies and McKellar showed that, notwithstanding the presence of complex instead of quaternionic phases, the predictions of quaternionic quantum mechanics differ from those of the usual theory.

Convolutional L2LFlows was submitted to the Fast Calorimeter Simulation Challenge for datasets 2 and 3 where a detailed comparison between recent models will be done.In conclusion, our work contributes to the evolution of generative modeling in high-energy physics, presenting a robust, scalable, and accurate method for modeling particle showers in complex detectors. As the field progresses towards more granular calorimeters and higher event rates, the importance of such advanced computational methods will only increase.\nCode Availability: The code for this study can be found under https://github.com/FLC-QU-hep/ConvL2LFlow.\nAcknowledgments: We thank Sascha Diefenbacher for early contributions to this work.

        " , , , , , , , , .The fast simulation of particle showers in highly granular calorimeters, as under construction for the HL-LHC and envisaged for many future collider detectors, is a particularly worthwhile application of generative methods. Simulating such calorimeter showers is typically done with Geant4 , , a detailed simulation from first principles that is very demanding in terms of CPU resources due to the necessary creation and tracking of a huge number of secondary particles through the entire geometry for every shower. Highly granular calorimeters sample particle showers across many layers, where every layer consists of an absorber material followed by a sensitive materials with readout cells of O(1-10)~mm sizes. The simulation of calorimeter showers need a substantial fraction of compute power at the LHC, even with less granular calorimeters that are currently in use, giving rise for large potential cost savings with generative methods.While normalizing flows achieve very high generative fidelity, they are so-far limited in their scalability to larger and more complex datasets. The causal conditioning in was a first step in making flow-based architectures more scalable. At the core of the problem lies that normalizing flows learn a diffeomorphism between data",

So far, normalizing flows have been among the models with the best fidelity. However, as the latent space in such models is required to have the same dimensionality as the data space, scaling up normalizing flows to high dimensional datasets is not straightforward. The prior L2LFlows approach successfully used a series of separate normalizing flows and sequence of conditioning steps to circumvent this problem. In this work, we extend L2LFlows to simulate showers with a 9-times larger profile in the lateral direction. To achieve this, we introduce convolutional layers and U-Net-type connections, move from masked autoregressive flows to coupling layers, and demonstrate the successful modelling of showers in the ILD Electromagnetic Calorimeter as well as Dataset 3 from the public CaloChallenge dataset.\nIntroduction: Motivated by the high computational cost of"

The result of the PS-method has a similar auto-correlation as well. However, the auto-correlations of the other two methods show that smaller structures are erroneously present in their output images.

Track isolation, on the other hand, helps to reject electrons that are accompanied by nearby energy deposition, which could indicate the presence of a hadron.

For systems having PBC of rotational invariant, in principles an analogous Bloch theorem can be developed and applied. Taking a ring-type cluster of cyclo[18]carbon as a representative, we theoretically suggest a quasi-band model and study its HHG by solving time-dependent Liouville-von Neumann equation. Under the irradiation of circularly polarized laser, explicit selection rules for left-handed and right-handed harmonics are observed, while in linearly polarized laser field, cyclo[18]carbon exhibits solid-like HHG originated from intra-band oscillations and inter-band transitions, which in turn is promising to optically detect the symmetry and geometry of controversial structures.

All sources presented here show a significant thermal component that we interpret as thermal bremsstrahlung from the ICM and thus are securely associated with the proposed clusters. Our sample contains 10 galaxy clusters. Table reports the position, significance, total exposure time and other details of all the detected clusters.\nSpectral Analysis: For each galaxy cluster we extracted a 15–195 keV spectrum with the method described in . Here we recall the main steps: the details can be found in the aforementioned paper. For a given source, we extract a spectrum from each observation where the source is in the field of view. These spectra are corrected for residual background contamination and for vignetting; the per-pointing spectra are then (weighted) averaged to produce the final source spectrum. Thus, the final spectrum represents the average source emission over the time-span considered here (2.5 years). The accuracy of these spectra is discussed in {{formula:df60d516-a702-461d-886"

Quantum resource theory (QRT) answers this type of question. QRT has been established in various areas of physics, e.g., quantum coherence , , superposition , athermallity , , and asymmetry . The QRT of nG is challenging because the set of Gaussian states is not convex, so the usual framework of QRT does not apply directly, and because of the infinite dimensional Hilbert space that is involved.

However, recent studies have shown that certain lattice formulations, such as Q-exact supersymmetric quantum mechanics, can be constructed without the need for supersymmetry-restoring CTs. The use of Calabi-Yau manifolds in these constructions can help to preserve the supersymmetry of the theory, leading to a more accurate description of the IR effective theory.

Our favorite answer of course would be that no symmetry-restoring CTs are required.Of course, CTs associated with renormalization are required unless the theory is finite. But these are CTs allowed by the continuum symmetry and will not concern us here.\nExamples without CTs: I will now enumerate several examples where no CTs are required. The point here is to familiarize the reader with the many successes, or claimed successes, that have been achieved in this regard. Some of these are quite recent.\nQ-exact supersymmetric quantum mechanics: In this case, one has a lattice version of a supercharge {{formula:38801602-26b7-44d6-936d-3d84c774564d}} that is nilpotent; i.e. {{formula:f116b210-53fd-4e00-954e-0b91e21340f6}} .

In either case, the continuum symmetry results without any adjustment of CTs. In some cases, the lattice theory explicitly breaks continuum symmetries, and the symmetries are only obtained through a fine-tuning of CTs. It may even be that no local CTs exist that will do the job, in which case we have an anomaly. We should study",

Whereas that study showed that radiative generation of supersymmetry violation in the continuum limit is not forbidden by lattice symmetries and dimensional arguments, recent Monte Carlo data seems to indicate no need for supersymmetry-restoring CTs , .In summary, much progress has been made recently in formulating supersymmetric theories on the lattice. In some cases, the theory has been nonperturbatively defined. Furthermore, numerical results have been obtained in a few cases, holding out the prospect that we will obtain interesting information by means other than the traditional, continuum methods.\nNonholomorphic woes: Now that we have seen that there are many promising formulations that define supersymmetric theories on the lattice, let us return to the motivations.

Therefore, the growth of the second component of the magnetic field is suppressed. Nevertheless, Figure REF shows that the instability arises in the first and third component of the magnetic field. However, the growth is delayed, since these two components were not initialised.On a Cartesian domain, the physical and the logical fields only differ by a constant scaling.

The advances in these simulation technologies have generated considerable amounts of data. However, a versatile and general tool for visualization, filtering, and denoising this data is largely lacking. To overcome these limitations, we have developed SpinView, a general interactive visual analysis tool for graphical exploration and data distillation. Combined with dynamic filters and a built-in database, it is possible to generate reproducible publication-quality images, videos, or portable interactive webpages within seconds. Since the basic input to SpinView is a vector field, it can be directly integrated with any spin dynamics simulation tool. With minimal effort on the part of the user, SpinView delivers a simplified workflow, speeds up analysis of complex datasets and trajectories, and enables new types of analysis and insight.

After the denoising filter, we constructed an isosurface with the Z-component equal to 0.3 and colored it with the Y-component under Jet colormaps in step IV. Finally, we use clip filters in Step V to eliminate the still-existing noise bubbles. Opacity is also tuned to make the generated isosurface transparent and allow the visualizable overlap between the isosurface and the glyph cone representation. With those operations, we finally revealed the topological structure inside of thermal noise, a common need for researchers interested in magnetic textures at finite temperatures.

Assuming symmetric mass ejection in black hole formation, we estimate the amount of mass that must have been ejected in the stellar core collapse in order to explain the velocities of the above X-ray binaries. We find that at least 2.6 M_sun and 4.1 M_sun must have been ejected in the formation of Cyg X-1 and Nova Sco, respectively. A similar mass loss fraction (f = 0.35) for the black hole binaries with low mass donors, gives low velocities, in agreement with the observations.

Hence, it is essential to identify all the DDI events before prescribing multiple drugs to a patient.

This is because his approach effectively ignores all contributions not containing a specific combination, resulting in the first order terms of the perturbation series not being fully recovered. Furthermore, simply exponentiating the first order result is insufficient for non-perturbative calculations, which require contributions of all orders to be fully included.

In contrast to (REF ), our influence functional (REF ) – as was also confirmed by JvD – includes all RPA diagrams in all orders and, hence, is suitable for non-perturbative calculations. Thus, the crucial difference between (REF ) and (REF ) becomes evident already by careful reading of last paragraphs of Sec. B6.2 of Ref. vD1.Unfortunately in other parts of that paper the wording is sometimes not so clear. For instance, in Sec. 3 on p. 9 JvD first acknowledges that “we got it completely right in the position-time representation” and then continues “unfortunately, however, it did not occur to them to use the frequency representation (4e)”. Having read these statements, the reader could easily conclude that JvD only passes to a different representation of the same influence functional. In reality, however, at this point JvD replaces our correct influence functional (REF ) by a very different object (REF ) which properties have already been discussed in Sec. I of this Comment.In Sec. 4",

For the latter reason already the first order terms of the perturbation series cannot be fully recovered from JvD's Eqs. (1-4). However, even if all the first order terms would be correctly reproduced by JvD, it would still be completely useless to simply exponentiate the first order result. The problem in question is essentially non-perturbative and, hence, contributions of all orders should be fully included , , , .After all these manipulations with diagrams JvD goes back to path integrals and constructs the functional (REF ) which, being expanded in the interaction, should generate JvD's diagrams obtained after his steps (1) to (3). Obviously, this functional has nothing to do with our influence functional (REF ) no matter whether one carries out momentum integrations or not. In fact, JvD himself acknowledges that “an accurate treatment of effects occurring in second or higher order is beyond the accuracy of” his “influence",

This finding is consistent with previous CO mm observations and optical observations, which also revealed a clumpy structure in the detached shells. The patchiness can be attributed to the small-scale structure of the circumstellar medium, which is influenced by various factors such as dust formation, grain growth, and gas-dust interactions. The observations of R Scl and U Cam shells, with their relatively simple and geometrically thin structures, offer an excellent opportunity to study the detailed density distribution of the circumstellar medium. The findings of this study can inform our understanding of stellar evolution and mass loss processes, particularly in the context of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. The detached shells around R Scl and U Cam are thought to have formed as a result of a brief period of intense mass loss, and their properties can provide clues about the mass loss mechanisms and the subsequent evolution of the star.

      "expected_output": "The utilization of Wigner functions for SU(1,1) in quantum metrology has significant implications for enhancing the precision of quantum measurements. By deriving a Wigner distribution for SU(1,1) as the expectation value of the displaced parity operator, it becomes possible to experimentally sample the Wigner function, which can lead to improved precision in quantum measurements. This is particularly relevant in modern metrology, where SU(1,1) symmetry plays a crucial role. The Wigner function for SU(1,1) provides a powerful tool for characterizing and analyzing quantum systems, enabling the exploration of novel quantum phenomena and the development of more accurate quantum measurement protocols. Furthermore, the ability to directly sample the Wigner function for SU(1,1) opens up new avenues for quantum information processing and quantum sensing applications, potentially leading to breakthroughs in fields such as quantum optics and quantum communication.",

        ", we eliminate the spurious degrees of freedom and we get a description on the upper sheet of a two-sheeted hyperboloid, which is the natural arena to represent the physics associated to these systems.Our final upshot is that the Wigner function can be expressed as the average value of the displaced parity operator. This is reassuring, for it is also the case for continuous variables . Moreover, as this property has been employed for the direct sampling of the Wigner function for a quantum field , , , our result opens the way for the experimental determination of the Wigner function for SU(1,1).\nPhase-space representation of a single mode: To keep the discussion as self-contained as possible, we first briefly summarize the essential ingredients of phase-space functions for a harmonic oscillator that we shall need for our purposes.We consider the standard oscillator described by annihilation and creation operators {{formula:16edb58a-725c-4a3e-80fe-f259a193b4cd}} and {{formula:1b253913-828a-4c98-bb8a-909f1c2b2787}} , which obey the bosonic commutation relation {{form",
        "# arXiv Paper: 1911.11703\n\nWigner function for SU(1,1)\nabstract: In spite of their potential usefulness, Wigner functions for systems with SU(1,1) symmetry have not been explored thus far. We address this problem from a physically-motivated perspective, with an eye towards applications in modern metrology. Starting from two independent modes, and after getting rid of the irrelevant degrees of freedom, we derive in a consistent way a Wigner distribution for SU(1,1). This distribution appears as the expectation value of the displaced parity operator, which suggests a direct way to experimentally sample it. We show how this formalism works in some relevant examples.\nIntroduction: Phase-space methods represent a self-standing alternative to the conventional Hilbert-space formalism of quantum theory. In this approach, observables are {{formula:4e2a32eb-c4da-4ae3-b499-cfba0bb3e0f8}} -number functions instead of operators, with the same interpretation as their classical counterparts, although composed in novel algebraic ways. Quantum mechanics thus appears as a statistical theory on phase space, which can make the corresponding classical limit emerge",
        "d5dd}}A word of caution is in order here. Strictly speaking, Wigner functions can be properly defined only for a single irrep, where the concept of phase space is uniquely defined. Nonetheless,since the Hilbert space of our original two-mode problem splits as in (REF ), our Wigner function appears as a sum over all the irreps in the discrete positive series.Let us consider the relevant example of SU(1,1) coherent states, defined as {{formula:c944bb1c-5190-4221-b0be-a509f24cb00f}}where {{formula:9b91521b-b69b-4de3-b409-aea1429a1c9f}} and {{formula:e6ca1fbe-1239-481c-8417-c0746dd8b999}} . These states live in the irrep {{formula:e85e7c84-b007-4d55-b1fa-3024687861fb}} and for {{formula:5e5adf9b-ace7-4fb2-91ce-b355aa0ca679"
